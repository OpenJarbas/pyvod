This is the original, unedited, full-length version which predates \"Metropolis\" by three years.\n\nFROM IMDB: This is called the first Soviet science fiction film because of its \"futuristic\" sets on Mars, although most of it takes place in Moscow. The movie is set at the beginning of the NEP (New Economic Policy) in December, 1921. A mysterious radio message is beamed around the world, and among the engineers who receive it are Los, the hero, and his colleague Spiridonov. Los is an individualist dreamer. Aelita is the daughter of Tuskub, the ruler of a totalitarian state on Mars in which the working classe are put into cold storage when they are not needed. With a telescope, Aelita is able to watch Los. As if by telepathy, Los obsesses about being watched by her. After some hugger-mugger involving the murder of his wife and a pursuing detective, Los takes the identity of Spiridonov and builds a spaceship. With the revolutionary Gusev, he travels to Mars, but the Earthlings and Aelita are thrown into prison by the dictator. Gusev and Los begin a proletarian uprising, and Aelita offers to lead the revolution, but she then establishes her own totalitarian regime. Los is shocked by this development and attempts to stop Aelita, and then reality and fantasy become confused, and Los discovers what has really happened. \n\nDirected by Yakov Protazanov\nReleased in 1924\ncomplete print, runtime 111.5 minutes\na.k.a. \"Revolt of the Robots\" and \"Aelita\" (original title)",

It also is a good example of how a bad movie can be a lot of fun. Ned Sparks’ over-the-top performance as a crotchety old crime author steals the show. A remake of the 1914 silent “The Conspiracy.” IMDB rating 5.7.Directed by Christy Cabanne.Released in 1930.Complete print.AKA “Sensation”CAST NOTE: Bessie Love is also here at IA the restored version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The Lost World” and the risque pre-code drama “Morals for Women.”https://archive.org/details/TheLostWorldCompleteVideoQualityUpgrade https://archive.org/details/MoralsForWomen_452 ",

However the 65mm widescreen prints, which no longer exist,  were exhibited in only two theaters, one in New York City and one in Chicago. All other theaters exhibited the standard 35mm print. The Depression and then World War 2 halted widescreen development for the time being.\n\nCAST NOTE: Louis Wolheim is best known today for his role in the oscar-winning anti-war classic, \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Its trailer is here at IA.",

Enjoy. (Don't be surprised if you are reminded of the current presidential campaign.)\n\nOur night of thrilling terror begins with the trailer for \"Panic in Year Zero,\" which tells us all we need to survive the coming nuclear holocaust is a camper-trailer and a few guns, but then the raping begins. The first feature presentation is \"Invasion USA,\" in which Commies from within and the Russians from without totally crush the US in a matter of days, and then the raping begins. The intermission short is \"Red Nightmare,\" in which the failure to attend PTA meetings leads to a Commie takeover. (sorry no raping) It's followed by that jaw-dropping bit of exploitation schlock produced in Hazlet, New Jersey, \"Rocket Attack USA.\" Sputnik and an absurd espionage mission bring on the nuking of New York City. At the end you may be forgiven for thinking someone should have nuked Hazlet, New Jersey.\n\n(Special thanks to content-contributing member Freddie Jaye for making \"Rocket Attack USA\" available.)",

Little attempt is made to expose the real horrors of Nazism or Goebbels' hate-driven personality. Instead it's more likely to induce giggles thanks to Wolfgang Zilzer's ham-fisted performance in the title role, which portrays Goebbles as little worse than a liar and vindictive rejected lover who abuses power. A romantic subplot only indirectly related to Goebbles takes up almost 1/3 of the film. (That was '40s Hollywood for ya.)  The listed supporting cast members are professionals but they can't help much.\n\nThis film only weakly qualifies as WW2 propaganda. In reality it is plain and simple exploitation.\n\nDirected by Alfred Zeisler.\nReleased in 1944.\nComplete print.\na.k.a. \"The Mad Lover\" (re-release).\n\nNOTE: The 1940 MGM film \"The Mortal Storm\" is a realistic and powerful indictment of life in Germany under the Nazis. Its trailer is here at IA. The film itself isn't. However it's widely available for sale or rental.",

Why is explained in  my review which has been lifted from a place whose name is no longer mentioned in polite society:\n\"This isn't the Greatest Generation's World War II. It is an absurd, low-budget attempt at making a spy drama that instead became an unintentional parody. It features a commissar with a Brooklyn-Russian accent; elderly waiters tottering around with secret notes; downed allied flyers having a hilariously good time in German-occupied France; the most unlikely bunch of Nazis outside of \"The Producers\"(1968); and that's just for starters. The plot is juvenile nonsense about a female Russian spy (Lola Lane) smuggled into Paris to save Anglo-American convoys. Her foil is John Vosper, who's laughably awful as a ruthless Nazi colonel who appears more like Hogan's Heroes' Colonel Klink. Lola lane's performance isn't much better. In fact, the only convincing cast members are those without lines. Capped with a jaw-dropping final scene, some might call \"Miss V from Moscow\" so bad it's good. I won't go that far, but I do give it three stars because this bizarre klinker must be seen to be believed.\" \nDirected by Albert Herman\nReleased in 1942\na.k.a. \"Intrigue in Paris\"\nComplete print",

The plot and dialog are more ridiculous than the original's. The sets are just as cheesy. The acting is much worse. An entertaining anti-masterpiece that’s bonanza for bad movie aficionados. In other words you gotta see it to believe it.

Also its timing couldn't have been worse. It was released during the absolute depths of the Depression on both sides of the Atlantic when the romantic foibles of the idle rich and their drunken motor boat races weren't likely to gain many fans. However a good supporting cast and excellent production values make this trans-Atlantic curiosity worth watching. Produced in the UK with an Anglo-American cast. IMDB rating 6.9.Directed by Cyril Gardner.Released in 1933 (UK & US).Complete Print. ",

No actors were used. Only RAF personnel appear (see cast note). Unfortunately the success shown did not reflect reality. Due to navigational errors and other factors, in 1941 the RAF’s night raids rarely hit anywhere near their targets. This would change for the better as the air war progressed.

They lasted into the late ‘50s when they were finally killed off by Saturday morning children’s TV programming. These three-hour extravaganzas for the cap pistol set consisted of a jumble of multiple cartoons (that often were racially insensitive), serial chapters and one or more feature films that always were B-westerns. Parents and girls (eeu!) weren’t banned, but I don’t remember either showing up. Saturday morning were the unchallenged domain of us vacant-lot cowboys.This morning’s program begins with matinee serials coming attractions followed by two cartoons and chapter 4 of “Flash Gordon,” and then two more cartoons. Next it’s chapter 5 of the first “Superman” serial. Which leaves us with just enough time for two more cartoons and the Tim McCoy B-western “Lightning Carson Rides Again.”So stock up on buttered popcorn and Good & Plenty. Then grab seats down front. The show is about to begin. We won’t see daylight again until sometime this afternoon. ",
