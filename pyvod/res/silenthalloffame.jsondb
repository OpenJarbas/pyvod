You can watch\nthe whole film here:\nhttps://silent-hall-of-fame.org/index.php/gems-for-donation\n \n \nWe have included this film in our program to illustrate the work and\ncontributions of our star Helen Gibson.\n\"The Governor's Special\" is a short action drama from a serial by\nthe name of \"The Hazards of Helen\", featuring Helen Gibson. This is\nepisode 76 from a total of 119 weekly one reel films produced by Kalem, showing\njust how popular this serial was in 1914-1917. The first 48 films starred Helen\nHolmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson. They both played heroines that\nwere independent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations with quick\nthinking. Their acting was very physical and they performed their often very\ndangerous stunts. It is believed to be the longest film series in the silent\nera and one of the longest ever. Very few of the films survive, and we are\nhappy to be able to show this rarity to our esteemed viewers.\nThe film is directed by James Davis from a story by Edward T. Matlack. In this\nepisode Helen Gibson performs one absolutely breathtaking stunt, which just\nshows how dangerous it was to act for silent film pioneers, especially for\nstuntmen and stuntwomen. \nThere is a twist to the plot, and Helen Gibson not only has to save her\ngovernor from mortal danger, but also the life of somebody close to her, who\nhas been sentenced to die without guilt.\n \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section\n107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

He was\nsuccessful in his native Sweden before making a career in the USA in\n1924-1930.  His Hollywood films are still copyrighted, this is why we show\nyou films from his previous years.\nA sailor tries to bring food to his starving family by breaking through a\nnaval blockade, but is captured. The enemy captain ignores his pleas and he is\nput in jail for years. Upon his return he is heartbroken to learn that his\nfamily did not survive. Then when a ship is wrecked during a storm the sailor\nrushes to help, but is astonished to find that same former captain fighting for\nhis life. The sailor now has a chance for revenge.\nDirected by                    \nVictor Sjöström (Seastrom)Produced by                  \nCharles MagnussonScenario            \n            Victor\nSeastromBased on                        \nthe poem by Henrik IbsenStarring                         \nVictor Seastrom, August Falck, Bergliot Husberg, Edith ErastoffCinematography           \nJ.

In the film he\nchases an engine to rescue a girl chained to the tracks by an evil unsuccessful\nsuitor. \nThe way Ford Sterling overplays the role of the villain makes one think that\nthe film was conceived as a parody of contemporary melodramas.\nThis is one of the first roles of Helen Holmes, in which she plays a village\nbeauty. She became the audacious star of \"The Hazards of Helen\" a\nyear and a half later, acting as the heroine of numerous railroad adventures.\nShe may have gotten inspiration from \"Barney Oldfield's Race for a\nLife\" and the race to save Mabel Normand.\nDirected by          \n     Mack SennettProduced by             \nKeystone Film CompanyStarring              \n      Mack Sennett, Mabel Normand, Ford Sterling, Barney\nOldfield, Helen HolmesCinematography       Lee Bartholomew,\nWalter WrightDistributed by           Mutual Film\nCorporationRelease date           \n   June 3, 1913Running time             13 min.Country               \n      United StatesLanguage              \n     Silent film, English intertitles\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

Larry authored a book on the life of Helen Gibson. \n\"Ghost of the Canyon\" is a short action drama. Scenario and\ndirection are by Robert Myles, story by R.A.Dillion, photographed by Carl\nWiden. In 1915-1917 Helen Gibson starred a serial by the name of \"The\nHazards of Helen\".  She is considered the first professional stunt\nwoman.  Very few of her films survive, so we are happy to be able to show\nyou this rarity.\nTwo railroad companies compete for a very lucrative contract.  Helen's\nfather is the first in command, and her fiance the second in one of the\ncompanies.  The rival company organizes a sabotage, which is exposed by\nHelen.  Unfortunately for her, she is alone against three men who tie her\nup to the railroad tracks.  She faces imminent death unless she finds a\nway to free herself from the ropes.\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

McGowan from a story by\nEdward T. Matlack, is a short action film from a serial by the name of\n\"The Hazards of Helen\" starring Helen Holmes.  This is episode\n26 from a total of 119 weekly one reel films produced by Kalem, showing just\nhow popular this serial was in 1914-1917.  The first 48 films starred\nHelen Holmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson.  They both played\nheroines that were independent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations\nwith quick thinking.  Their acting was very physical and they performed\ntheir often very dangerous stunts.  It is believed to be the longest film\nseries in the silent era and one of the longest ever. \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

McGowan from a\nstory by Edward T. Matlack.  A total of 119 weekly one reel films were\nproduced by Kalem, showing just how popular this serial was in 1914-1917. \nThe first 48 films starred Helen Holmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen\nGibson.  They both played heroines that were independent and adventurous,\nresolving dangerous situations with quick thinking.  Their acting was very\nphysical and they performed their often very dangerous stunts.  It is\nbelieved to be the longest film series in the silent era and one of the longest\never.  Very few of the films survive, and we are happy to  be able to\nshow this rarity to our esteemed viewers.\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

A drug lord must deal with\nunintended consequences.\n    The film became contentious even before hitting the screens.\n\"Cocaine\" was banned as it was feared that it would encourage drug\nuse. The film's message, however, is exactly the opposite. Eventually\n\"Cocaine\" was approved by the board of censors under the alternative and\nless provocative title \"While London Sleeps\".

Arthur V. Johnson plays a policeman,\nRobert Harron is a messenger and Florence Lawrence is the first daughter. D.W.\nGriffith gets an acting credit as well, apart from the director's job.

Ironically, when they\nseek help to counter the second more violent criminal, the only person\navailable is the first thief.\n \nDirected by                \n      D.W.

His\nuseless existence is interrupted for one day, when a woman gives him food and\nhe finds a way to repay her.\n \nNOTE:\nAll film sites cite a film \"The Wanderer\" (1913) directed by D.W.\nGriffith and starring Henry B. Walthall as the Wanderer, who also plays a\nflute. As you can see, in our film there is no flute and Henry B. Walthall does\nnot act.\nThe film that we show matches the description of \"Olaf - An Atom\"\n(1913) directed by Anthony O’Sullivan, also a Biograph Company production, and\nstarring Harry Carey. \nThe opening titles show \"The Wanderer\" and we will leave it as it\nis.\nUPDATE:\nA film \"The Wanderer\" (1913) directed by D.W. Griffith and\nstarring Henry B. Walthall has emerged. Thus, even if the film described here\nbears the title \"The Wanderer\", we believe that this is a mistake,\nand in reality this is \"Olaf - An Atom\" (1913) directed by Anthony\nO’Sullivan.\n \nDirected by                \n      unknown (see NOTE above)Cinematography by         Billy BitzerStarring                 \n           Harry Carey, Claire McDowell, Charles\nHill MailesDistributed by               \n   Biograph CompanyRelease date                \n      May, 1913Country                  \n          United StatesRunning time           \n        10 m.\n \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section\n107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

Here are just a few of the reviews for this film:\n    The film will be the special attraction at the Wintergarden.\nIt is one of the most entertaining pictures that has been screened for some\ntime. It is bright, well directed, with a wonderful cast, rich sets, and many\nwholesome laughs.  The picture is chockful of entertainment, and a great\ndeal of credit is due to the portrayals of the various roles by an unusually\ngood cast of screen favorites.  Marceline Day, who plays the title role,\nis beautiful, charming, and a screen player of great promise.  The rest of\nthe players are well cast.  The direction is of the best. (Queensland\nFigaro)\n    The story is well plotted, the situations novel, and the\npicture highly entertaining.  The continuity excellent. (Telegraph)\n    Marceline Day is charming, a very good actress and chock\nfull of appeal. (Variety)\n    The film is excellent entertainment for any theater. It has\nspirited action, good characterizations and a human and comical story. (Moving\nPicture World)\n    Pleasing story, nicely told. Light tale that has plenty of\nattractive angles to entertain general run of audiences.  The film is\nimportant in that it brings to the fore a new luminary in the person of\nMarceline Day in the leading role, that of a drab, unattractive sartorially,\nand, because of that, physically, cashier who from the chrysalis becomes the\nmost gorgeous and radiant of butterflies.

The censored US print that we have is missing some scenes.\nApparently the plot is this:\nA wealthy gardener (Victor Seastrom) breaks up the possible engagement of\nhis son to the daughter of a man who works for him. After the son is forced to\nleave the gardener rapes the girl and then drives her and her father away. The\ngirl is temporarily cared for in the home of an elderly benefactor, but when he\ndies she is driven away yet again, and apparently turns to prostitution. In the\nend she returns to the place of that fateful encounter with the rapist that\ndestroyed her life.\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section\n107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

He would change it five years\nlater when he was on his way to becoming a leading luminary of Westerns.\n\"The Car of Death\" is the earliest surviving film with Jack\nHoxie that we have, so we can see the beginning of his illustrious career.\nJack Hoxie and Helen Holmes partnered again in two Westerns, which probably\ndon't survive - \"Fighting Fury\" (1924) and \"The Sign of the\nCactus\" (1925).

Matlack, is a short action film from a serial by the name of\n\"The Hazards of Helen\" starring Helen Holmes.  This is episode\n13 from a total of 119 weekly one reel films produced by Kalem, showing just\nhow popular this serial was in 1914-1917.  The first 48 films starred\nHelen Holmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson.  They both played\nheroines that were independent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations\nwith quick thinking.  Their acting was very physical and they performed\ntheir often very dangerous stunts.  It is believed to be the longest film\nseries in the silent era and one of the longest ever.  Very few of the\nfilms survive, and we are happy to  be able to show this rarity to our\nesteemed viewers.\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

The film features Jenny\nHasselqvist, Matheson Lang, Victor Sjöström and others.\nVictor Sjöström was successful in his native Sweden before making a career in\nthe USA in 1924-1930.  His Hollywood films are still copyrighted, this is\nwhy we show you a film from his previous years. \"The Hell Ship\" was\nthe last film he made in his native country before starting a career in the\nUSA. Perhaps this was the film that convinced Hollywood producers and directors\nto invite him, and that invitation paid off, because Victor Sjöström created a\nnumber of masterpieces in the years to come.\n\nA sailor's attempts to find work are unsuccessful for a long time. When he\nfinally lands a job he discovers in horror that the ship's cargo is a mortal\ndanger for everybody on board.\n \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section\n107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

Matlack and Frank Howard Clark, is a short action film from\na serial by the name of \"The Hazards of Helen\" starring Helen\nHolmes. This is episode 9 from a total of 119 weekly one reel films\nproduced by Kalem, showing just how popular this serial was in 1914-1917. \nThe first 48 films starred Helen Holmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen\nGibson. They both played heroines that were independent and adventurous,\nresolving dangerous situations with quick thinking.  Their acting was very\nphysical and they performed their often very dangerous stunts.  It is\nbelieved to be the longest film series in the silent era and one of the longest\never.  \nMany of the episodes, including this one, tell about railroad adventures. A\ndisgruntled fired worker decides to get even by tampering with the brakes of a\nlarge train. Helen receives the news at an intermediate station and has to\ntry and fix the problem before disaster strikes.\n \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section\n107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

Matlack, is a short action film from a serial by the name of\n\"The Hazards of Helen\" starring Helen Gibson.  This is episode\n63 from a total of 119 weekly one reel films produced by Kalem, showing just\nhow popular this serial was in 1914-1917.  The first 48 films starred\nHelen Holmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson.  They both played\nheroines that were independent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations\nwith quick thinking.  Their acting was very physical and they performed\ntheir often very dangerous stunts.  It is believed to be the longest film\nseries in the silent era and one of the longest ever.  \n Helen Gibson is a railway station operator who gets caught in a\nfederal investigation of counterfeit money.  There is a lot of action in\nthis episode with one particularly dangerous stunt performed by Helen Gibson as\nshe chases a runaway locomotive on motorcycle.\n \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section\n107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

You can watch\nthe whole film here:\nhttps://silent-hall-of-fame.org/index.php/gems-for-donation\n \n \nWe have included this film in our program to illustrate the work and\ncontributions of our star Helen Holmes.\n \"The Pay Train\" directed by J.P. McGowan from a story by\nEdward T. Matlack, is a short action drama from a serial by the name of\n\"The Hazards of Helen\" starring Helen Holmes. This is episode 31 from\na total of 119 weekly one reel films produced by Kalem, showing just how\npopular this serial was in 1914-1917. The first 48 films starred Helen Holmes,\nthe remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson. They both played heroines that were\nindependent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations with quick\nthinking. Their acting was very physical and they performed their often very\ndangerous stunts.  It is believed to be the longest film series in the\nsilent era and one of the longest ever. Very few of the films survive, and we\nare happy to  be able to show this rarity to our esteemed viewers.\nMany of the episodes, including this one, tell about railroad adventures. Hoot\nGibson has a modest role as one of the evildoers. He would become one of the\nluminaries of Western films in the years to come.\n \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section\n107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

The orphan girl is\nplayed by Jean Darnell, not by Florence La Badie. Florence La Badie plays the\nvisiting girl.\nJean Darnell is in love with her guardian (Harry Benham), who is only\ninterested in Florence La Badie. One day both girls are taken to the hospital\nafter a car accident and Jean Darnell believes that she has a chance to take\nher rival out of the way. However, after that her guilty conscience won't let\nher be.\nLet's all give our thanks to Ned Thanhouser for the outstanding work he has\ndone for the past 25+ years in archives around the globe to acquire and publish\non DVD and online Thanhouser films starring Florence La Badie. \nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.

Larry authored a book on the life of Helen Gibson. \n\"The Wrong Train Order\" is a short action drama from a serial by\nthe name of \"The Hazards of Helen\", featuring Helen Gibson. This is\nepisode 58 from a total of 119 weekly one reel films produced by Kalem, showing\njust how popular this serial was in 1914-1917. The first 48 films starred Helen\nHolmes, the remaining 71 starred Helen Gibson. They both played heroines that\nwere independent and adventurous, resolving dangerous situations with quick\nthinking. Their acting was very physical and they performed their often very\ndangerous stunts. It is believed to be the longest film series in the silent\nera and one of the longest ever. \nThe film is directed by James Davis from a story by Edward T. Matlack. In this\nepisode everything goes wrong. Helen ends up on the rear observation deck of a\nrunaway express train with the door to the inside closed, with the air-brake of\nthe engine damaged, the engine itself full of steam and inaccessible, and the train\nspeeding ahead on the wrong track.\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\"Allowance is made for\n\"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,\nteaching, scholarship, and research.
