It costed 50,000 pounds when the average Australian film was made for around 1000 pounds.\n\nThe film stars George Fisher as Richard Devine/Rufus Dawes/John Rex and Eva Novak as Sylvia Vickers and was adapted, produced and directed by Norman Dawn, who later went to Hollwood and made classic B-grade movies like \"Bowanga Bowanga\" and \"Two Lost Worlds\".\n\n\"For The Term of His Natural Life\" was remade as a 6 episode 9 hour mini series with Colin Friels and Anthony Perkins.\n\nIMDB Page",

            "description": "The first film adaptation of the often filmed Mary Shelley story. This film was originally released on March 18 1910.\n\nFrom the Edison Kinetogram:\nFrankenstein, a young student, is seen bidding his sweetheart and father goodbye, as he is leaving home to enter a college in order to study the sciences. Shortly after his arrival at college he becomes absorbed in the mysteries of life and death to the extent of forgetting practically everything else.\n\nHis great ambition is to create a human being, and finally one night his dream is realized. He is convinced that he has found a way to create a most perfect human being that the world has ever seen. We see his experiment commence and the development of it. To Frankenstein's horror, instead of creating a marvel of physical beauty and grace, there is unfolded before his eyes and before the audience an awful, ghastly, abhorrent monster. As he realizes what he has done Frankenstein rushes from the room, only to have the misshapen monster peer at him through the curtains of his bed. He falls fainting to the floor, where he is found by his servant, who revives him.\n\nAfter a few weeks' illness, he returns home, a broken, weary man, but under the loving care of father and sweetheart he regains his health and strength and begins to take a less morbid view of life. In other words, the story of the film brings out the fact that the creation of the monster was only possible because Frankenstein had allowed his normal mind to be overcome by evil and unnatural thoughts. His marriage is soon to take place. But one evening, while sitting in his library, he chances to glance in the mirror before him and sees the reflection of the monster which has just opened the door of his room. All the terror of the past comes over him and, fearing lest his sweetheart should learn the truth, he bids the monster conceal himself behind the curtain while he hurriedly induces his sweetheart, who then comes in, to stay only a moment. The monster, who is following his creator with the devotion of a dog, is insanely jealous of anyone else. He snatches from Frankenstein's coat the rose which his sweetheart has given him, and in the struggle throws Frankenstein to the floor, here the monster looks up and for the first time confronts his own reflection in the mirror. Appalled and horrified at his own image he flees in terror from the room. Not being able, however to live apart from his creator, he again comes to the house on the wedding night and, searching for the cause of his jealousy, goes into the bride's room. Frankenstein coming into the main room hears a shriek of terror, which is followed a moment after by his bride rushing in and falling in a faint at his feet. The monster then enters and after overpowering Frankenstein's feeble efforts by a slight exercise of his gigantic strength leaves the house.\n\nWhen Frankenstein's love for his bride shall have attained full strength and freedom from impurity it will have such an effect upon his mind that the monster cannot exist. The monster, broken down by his unsuccessful attempts to be with his creator, enters the room, stands before a large mirror and holds out his arms entreatingly. Gradually, the real monster fades away, leaving only the image in the mirror. A moment later Frankenstein himself enters. As he stands directly before the mirror he see's the image of the monster reflected instead of his own. Gradually, however, under the effect of love and his better nature, the monster's image fades and Frankenstein sees himself in his young manhood in the mirror. His bride joins him, and the film ends with their embrace, Frankenstein's mind now being relieved of the awful horror and weight it has been laboring under for so long.",

It is based on a classic Australian novel by Rolf Boldrewood (the pen name of Thomas Browne). \n\nThis was the third film of the novel. The first, directed by Charles McMahon, was an early feature film made shortly after \"The Story of the Kely Gang\". The second was made in 1911. The 1957 Rank Organisation production starring Peter Finch was one of the most popular Australian films of the 1950s. It was again remade as a TV mini-series in 1985 starring Sam Neill.\n\nThe 1920 version is one of the few surviving independently produced Australian silent films.\n\nThis version comes from a video tape released by the New South Wales Department of Education, Sydney in 1984. This is from a multi-generational VHS copy. I have put the video through as much video noise reduction as I could without effecting the image. Its not very good quality but this is a decent movie and a valuable artifact. There is no musical soundtrack. This video is completely silent.",

            "description": "The film is based on C.J. Dennis' 1915 Australian poem The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke. The film was produce by a South Australian company, The Southern Cross Feature film Co, and shot in New South Wales. Most of the exteriors were filmed in the Sydney suburb Woolloomooloo, Manley Beach, Bondi and The Royal Botanical Gardens, Sydney. Interiors were shot at Wonderland City in Bondi. The text on the inter-titles (designed by Lyell) was taken directly from Dennis' poem.\n\nRaymond Longford and Lottie Lyell, the writers/directors/stars were the most successful film partnership in Australia at the time. This film broke all existing box office records after debuting on October 4 1919 at Melbourne Town Hall in Victoria. \n\nThis version comes from a second generation VHS copy from a U-Matic video tape distributed by the New South Wales Department of Education in the early 1980s. This is an incomplete version of the film which is Public Domain as all motion picture and literary copyrights in this version have expired under Australian Law.\n\nThe negative of this film was recently discovered in the archives of George Eastman House (mislabled \"The Sentimental Blonde\"). The copyright restored edition premiered in 2004.\n\nThere is no musical accompaniment on this video. It is completely silent. The video quality is not great. I have uploaded the film due to a number of requests and because there is not enough PD Australian cinema freely available.\n\nCast:\n\nArthur Tauchert\t...The Bloke\nLottie Lyell...Doreen\nGilbert Emery...Ginger Mick\nStanley Robinson...The Bloke's Friend\nHarry Young...The Stror 'at Coot\nMargaret Reid..Mother\nCharles Keegan...Parson\nWilliam Coulter...Uncle Jim\nHelen Fergus...Nurse\nC.J.

The story is partly based on two Conan Doyle short stories: \"The Final Problem\" and \"The Empty House\".\n\nSceptical about the potential success of the film, the producers sold the rights to the film to \"First Division Pictures\" for 800 pounds. The film was released in July 1931 under the title \"Sherlock Holmes' Fatal Hour\". It was very successful, running for over a month on Broadway, which was unprecidented for a British produced programmer. \n\nReviews hailed the film for \"bringing the real Sherlock Holmes to the screen.\" This prompted 4 more movies in the series The Missing Rembrandt (still considered lost), The Sign of Four, The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes and The Silver Blaze/Murder at the Baskervilles. \n\nThis film was deemed lost when the only known print (a 16 mm reduction print of the US version) went missing after being shown at a Sherlock Holmes Society reception for Arthur Wontner in 1955. This version comes from a second generation copy with the titles replaced due to focus/framing issues.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The film is public domain. The above descriptive text is not.

It features a short 12 minute explanation of the sinking of RMS Lusitania after it was struck by two torpedoes fired from a German U-boat. The film was one of many animated silent films published to create anti-German sentiment during World War I. McCay illustrated some 25,000 drawings for the production. The film is stylized as a documentary, informing viewers on details from the actual event, including a moment by moment recap, casualty list, and a list of prominent figures who were killed.",

Lasky, the screenplay was adapted by Beulah Marie Dix from the 1905 stage play, of the same name, written by Edwin Milton Royle.\nThis first screen version of the story was the legendary DeMille's first movie assignment. It also holds the distinction of being the first feature-length movie filmed specifically in Hollywood. It was not the first to be made in the Los Angeles area, and film historians agree that shorts had previously been filmed in Hollywood, with In Old California considered the earliest. Harbor scenes were shot in San Pedro, California and the western saloon set was built beside railroad tracks in the San Fernando Valley. Footage of cattle on the open range were shot at Keen Camp near Idyllwild, California, while snow scenes were shot at Mount Palomar.\nThe Squaw Man went on to become the only movie successfully filmed three times by the same director/producer, DeMille. He did a silent remake in 1918, and a talkie version in 1931.",

            "description": "Filmed in November 1903 at Edison's New York studio, at Essex County Park in New Jersey, and along the Lackawanna railroad and released in December 1903, \"The Great Train Robbery\" is considered to be one of the first significant early US narrative films. Greatly influenced by the British film \"Daring Daylight Robbery\" (1903) it introduced many new cinematic techniques (cross cutting, double exposure, camera movement and location shooting) to American audiences. It was directed by Edwin S Porter and stars Justus D. Barnes as the head bandit, G. M. Anderson as a slain passenger and a robber, Walter Cameron as the sheriff.\n\nFrom the Edison Film Catalogue 1904:\nThis sensational and highly tragic subject will certainly make a decided `hit' whenever shown. In every respect we consider it absolutely the superior of any moving picture ever made. It has been posed and acted in faithful duplication of the genuine `Hold Ups' made famous by various outlaw bands in the far West, and only recently the East has been shocked by several crimes of the frontier order, which fact will increase the popular interest in this great Headline Attraction.\nScene 1 - Interior of railroad telegraph office. Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to set the `signal block' to stop the approaching train, also making him write an order to the engineer to take water at this station....\nScene 2 - At the railroad water tank. The bandit band are seen hiding behind the tank as a train stops to take water (according to false order). Just before she pulls out they stealthily board the train between the express car and the tender.\nScene 3 - Interior of express car.... the two robbers have succeeded in effecting an entrance. They enter cautiously. The messenger opens fire on them. A desperate pistol duel takes place, in which the messenger is killed. One of the robbers stands watch while the other tries to open the treasure box. Finding it locked, he searches the messenger for the key. Not finding it, he blows the safe up with dynamite.... \nScene 4 - The fight on the tender. This thrilling scene was taken from the mail car showing the tender and interior of locomotive cab, while the train is running forty miles an hour....\nScene 5 - The train uncoupled....\nScene 6 - Exterior of passenger coaches. The bandits compel the passengers to leave coaches with hands aloft, and line up along the tracks. One of the robbers covers them with large pistols in either hand, while the others ransack travelers' pockets. A passenger makes an attempt to escape, but is instantly shot down....\nScene 7 - The escape. The desperadoes board the locomotive with their booty, command the engineer to start his machine, and disappear in the distance.\nScene 8 - Off to the mountains. The robbers bring the engine to a stop several miles from the scene of the `Hold Up,' and take to the mountains.\nScene 9 - A beautiful scene in a valley. The bandits come down the side of a hill on a run and cross a narrow stream. Mounting their horses, which were tied to nearby trees, they vanish into the wilderness.\nScene 10 - Interior of telegraph office. The operator lies bound and gagged on the floor. After a desperate struggle, he succeeds in standing up. Leaning on the table, he telegraphs for assistance by manipulating the key with his chin, and then faints from exhaustion. His little daughter enters.... cuts the ropes, and, throwing a glass of water in his face, restores him to consciousness. Arising in a bewildered manner, he suddenly recalls his thrilling experience, and rushes forth to summon assistance.\nScene 11 - Interior of a dance hall.... typical Western dance house scene.... Suddenly the door opens and the half dead telegraph operator staggers in. The crowd gathers around him, while he relates what has happened.... The men secure their guns and hastily leave in pursuit of the outlaws.\nScene 12 - The posse in pursuit. Shows the robbers dashing down a rugged mountain at a terrible pace, followed closely by a large posse, both parties firing as they proceed. One of the desperadoes is shot....\nScene 13 - The remaining three bandits, thinking they had eluded their pursuers, have dismounted from their horses.... and begin to examine the contents of the mail bags.... The pursuers, having left their horses, steal noiselessly down upon them until they are completely surrounded. A desperate battle then takes place. After a brave stand, all of the robbers and several of the posse bite the dust.\nScene 14 - Realism. Full frame of Barnes, leader of the outlaw band, taking aim and firing point blank at the audience. (This effect was gained by foreshortening in making the picture). \"The resulting excitement is great. This section of the scene can be used either to begin the subject or to end it, as the operator may choose.\n\nRemastered, tinted and new soundtrack added in 2010.",

            "description": "Australian Silent film based on the Fatty Finn comic strips.\n\nThis was the last silent film made in Australia. It was shot in the Sydney streets in 1927. The suburb where it is set is Wooloomoloo, which is an inner city suburb between the CBD and Potts Point. At the time this was film was made, it was a poor area. It is now an expensive, trendy suburb. The billy goat race had to be filmed in Queensland as the New South Wales government had banned such races a year before this film was made.\n\nThe projection speed has been corrected so the film runs a little longer than other versions. The soundtrack included here is a collection of popular style recordings from the time approximating the original musical accompanyment.\n\nThis film has been in the Australian public domain since 1978. It was published in the USA without the necessary copyright formalities and its copyright was not restored by GATT due to its public domain status in Australia.",

            "description": "This rare Sherlock Holmes film was released at the same time as the Raymond Massey picture \"The Speckled Band\". The story is partly based on two Conan Doyle short stories: \"The Final Problem\" and \"The Empty House\".\n\nSceptical about the potential success of the film, the producers sold the rights to the film to \"First Division Pictures\" for 800 pounds. The film was released in July 1931 under the title \"Sherlock Holmes' Fatal Hour\". It was very successful, running for over a month on Broadway, which was unprecidented for a British produced programmer. \n\nReviews hailed the film for \"bringing the real Sherlock Holmes to the screen.\" This prompted 4 more movies in the series The Missing Rembrandt (still considered lost), The Sign of Four, The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes and The Silver Blaze/Murder at the Baskervilles. \n\nThis film was deemed lost when the only known print went missing after being shown at a Sherlock Holmes Society reception for Arthur Wontner in 1955. The version presented here is pieced together from two separate prints to create the longest and best quality version of the film. There are noticable differences between the two prints. The lesser quality print is only used to fill in minor sections that were missing or incomplete in the better quality version. It has the US title \"Sherlock Holmes' Fatal Hour\" on screen. The quality is still not optimal, but it is a major improvement from the versions previously available.",

It was created to fulfill a contractual obligation associated with Baum's personal bankruptcy caused by The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays, from which it was once thought to have been derived. It was partly based on the 1902 stage musical, though much of the film deals with the Wicked Witch of the West, who does not appear in the musical.",

This 1933 picture features matinee idol Chester Morris as an author intent on writing a book about the notorious criminal. He visits criminal expert Thornton Drake to get more information about the case. When someone receives the killer's calling card (the \"ace of spades\") the mystery begins. This is a wonderfully entertaining old fashioned mystery movie with all the hallmarks - an old house, servants, guests, a dashing hero, some bumbling detectives and a murderer among them.",
