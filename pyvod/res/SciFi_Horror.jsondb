            "description": "Letterboxed.\nNot to be confused with Al Adamson's Dracula vs. Frankenstein. This is the second film in Jacinto Molina aka Paul Naschy's Valdemar the Werewolf series of movies. (The first was \"Frankenstein's Bloody Terror\") Also known as \"The Man from UMMO', it stars Michael Rennie (dubbed by a different actor) as an alien from planet Ummo who resurrects three dead mad scientists in an attempt to collect all the worlds monsters to take over the Earth. There's a Vampire called Nosferatu, a living mummy, a Frankenstein wanna-be called \"The \"Faranksalon\" (literally \"Franken-science\") Monster and the wolfman played by Naschy. \n\nCompletely bizarre movie mixing science fiction with gothic horror.\nIt seems to be trying to recapture the feel of Universal's House of Frankenstein/Dracula formula rather than imitate Hammer, as European horror's often do. This could have been great, and indeed has a fan following, had they left out the space invaders, who seem completely out of place here.\n\nThis movie was offered to Independent International and even they turned it down!!! The soundtrack goes in and out of sync. Sorry. Maybe you can download it and fix it.",

The said new scenes in BATTLE were directed by Francis Ford Coppola and the ones in VOYAGE were directed by Peter Bogdonovich under a pseudonym.

This comes from when they were originally intended to be released as a double feature.\n\n\"Contrary to popular belief, this film was not directed by Kenneth G. Crane, was not made in 1970, was not produced by Toei Company, and was not titled \"The Double Garden\". It was originally filmed in 1966 as \"Body of the Prey\" and it was produced and directed by Norman Thomson. Thomson was the popular pulp novelist of the Burns Bannion series, which he wrote under his pen name 'Earl Thomson'. The production was assisted by members of the United States military bases in Japan and shot on location there. During production, Al Rickett wrote about the making of this film in the 'Stars & Stripes' newspaper, as well as having a small part as a gas station owner. However, while Edward D. Wood Jr. claimed he wrote the script for this film under the title \"Venus Flytrap\" and placed it on his resumes, reports of the making of the film in 'Stars & Stripes' claim Thomson wrote the script. It's possible that Wood sold the script to Thomson and it was slightly re-written before production. It's undetermined if the completed film was released theatrically, in either Japan or the United States.\"\n\nI have taken the liberty of replacing the credits with the data listed on the IMDb, footage from the Moody Institute's \"Carnivorous Plants,\" and a little music from \"Knife of the Party.\" I did it with my handy-dandy NERO. Since this created a NEW work under the law, despite being a simple combination of Public Domain works, I slapped a copyright notice on the back. Hack those off and the film belongs to everyone. If you don't, expect trouble from YouTube!  The original VHS release can be downloaded from Public Domain Movie Torrents, complete with incorrect credits under the \"Revenge of Dr. X\" title.\n\nWhether or not Ed Wood had anything to do with this steaming dogflop of a film, it's certainly worthy of his name!",

These scenes, presumably shot in 16mm, were never intended for theatrical release, but crop to a 16 x 9 aspect ratio (along with the rest of the film) as though that had been a possibility. This is just about as good an image as you'll find on this title, but the beginning is a little rough.Creature from the Haunted SeaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaCreature from the Haunted SeaTheatrical release posterDirected byRoger CormanProduced byRoger CormanCharles HannawaltWritten byCharles B.

            "description": "One of Larry Buchanan's notorious \"Azalea\" pictures -- made-for-TV color remakes of American International Pictures black and white drive-in creature features, made for a fraction of the originals' budgets.  Curse of the Swamp Creature is a rehash of 1957's Voodoo Woman.\n\nA mad scientist works in the middle of the swamp to create a monster that will serve his bidding.  The actor playing the scientist is a ham of the highest order, and everyone else (including especially our hero, John Agar) is a block of wood.\n\nBuchanan's signature editing style is in evidence here -- shots cut together that no rational mind can possibly connect to each other in either space or time, presented as \"different angles\" of the same scene. While it is indisputably bad, it is far from his wackiest editing adventure.\n\nTHIS MOTION PICTURE LACKS A COPYRIGHT NOTICE, AND IS THEREFORE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.",

The style is deliberately murky, and it has not so much as an inter-title, so that you do need to know at least the basic plot in order to understand what is happening. Check out the Jean Epstein version, too (also 1928).\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018873/",

            "description": "Victor Frankenstein (puzzlingly called \"Count\" Frankenstein here) discovers neanderthals living in a cave near his castle. When one of them is injured, Frankenstein revives him as his newest cut-n-paste creation, a giant fuzzy haired beast called \"Goliath\". He even has help from an servant named \"Ygor\" Meanwhile, Frankenstein's perverted dwarf assistant \"Genz\" has befriended an older, mute, cave dweller; a hairy wild-man named \"Ook\" and uses him to procure young lovelies for Genz to fondle, as well as to take revenge on his unsympathetic master. Meanwhile, Frankenstein is courting his daughter's best friend who is young enough to be his granddaughter, and the village people are becoming suspicious about the goings on at Castle Frankenstein (But, don't they always?) and also want to know who is lurking in the neanderthal's cave.\n\nAnother European horror that attempts to imitate the Hammer style and falls a bit short. As always, the final product is bizarre, but in this case its not as bad as you may have heard. This is the superior European edit of the film and is more entertaining than the U.S. release, which repeated the same sequences a few times and pointlessly rearranged some scenes. \n\nIncredibly, one of the actor's is credited as Boris Lugosi!?!? I have wonder if Bela Karloff is in this film too. Uncredited perhaps. Note also, that four different actors are credited as Frankenstein's \"Monsters\".\n\nThis film is available from home video companies that are know to deal exclusively in Public Domain properties. No ownership is claimed.",

He's also been testing a drug on Trudy when he's not hitting on her, and otherwise behaving badly. Needing a brain (always the Frankenstein Achilles Heel), and when sexually spurned on a date with Trudy's friend Suzie, he seizes the moment and runs her down with his car. After successfully transplanting her brain, he dubs the creature his daughter. More mayhem ensues, with Oliver and his daughter coming to their end at the hands of Trudy's beau, Johnny.\n\nStars: John Ashley, Sandra Knight, Donald Murphy, Sally Todd, Harold Lloyd, Jr., Felix Locher, and Wolfe Barzell\n\nIMDb Page\n\nThis VHS transferred copy is better than either this or this one, but like them it has a 4:3 aspect ratio rather than the movie's original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.",

As a child, Kevin was kidnapped by Freddy Krueger before Freddy was killed by a mob of angry parents. Although he he rescued by the detective that arrested Krueger, he was left scarred emotionally and psychologically. 13 years have passed, and Kevin's family has moved back to Elm Street, stirring up Kevin's darkest memories. A weakened, desperate Freddy, trapped in the dream world by his mother, a nun named Sister Mary Helena, following the events of Nightmare 5 has caught Kevin's scent, the one that got away. \n\nFreddy's Return stars David Buczynski as Kevin Marks, Jennifer Farr as Ashleigh Asoa, a Native American girl with mysterious ties to Kevin's past, Ashlly Lynn as Sister Mary Helena, and Justin Edwards as Memory Krueger, Freddy before he was burned to death. \n\nWritten and Directed by Jason Korsiak, who appears as Freddy in the film, Freddy's Return is two hours long, and seven years in the making.\n\n2009.

This is an attempt to recreate the original aspect ratio using the best public domain print I could find. The 16mm print seemed to be already slightly cropped and a true 1:85 ratio looked too cramped. This version has been blown-up and cropped at about 1:75, not the correct ratio, but much closer to the intended composition.Killers from SpaceKillers from Space is a 1954 American black and white science fiction feature film, produced and directed by W.

The foreign sales title for the film was Gappa: The Triphibian Monster, and was dubbed into English (considered the \"International Version\").

Their player wont re- size to the 320x240 frame size. To see it in its full quality, download the cinepak version,which is the original AVI file i uploaded. That version looks really good to me.

Tinted scenes and beautiful quality.  I have seen the current version here at archive.org and decided to post this one as it is of much better video quality, although the music is a nit hokey.  Enjoy this classic horror with the very creepy Max Schrek as the (IMHO) best vampire ever to waltz across the silver screen.\n\n\n(IMDB.COM Description)\nAn unauthorized production of Bram Stoker's work (The legal heirs didn't give their permission), so the names had to be changed. But this wasn't enough: The widow of Bram Stoker won two lawsuits (1924 and 1929) in which she demanded the destruction of all copies of the movie, however happily copies of it were already too widespread to destroy them all. Later, Universal studios could break her resistance against this movie. Count Orlok's move to Wisburg (Obviously the real \"Wismar\") brings the plague traceable to his dealings with the Realtor Thomas Hutter, and the Count's obsession with Hutter's wife, Ellen the only one with the power to end the evil.\n\nDVD Empire Description\n\nA Symphony Of Horror\n\nA long time ago in middle Europe, a decrepit, forbidding castle stood... Casting an ominous shadow over the townspeople who dare not look upon it, the unholy dwelling is home to one Count Orlok (Max Schreck) , an undead night creature with a taste for human blood.\n\nInto this picture steps Hutter, an unwary traveler who visits the Count. He carries with him the deed for a property Orlock wishes to buy in Hutter's home town of Wisborg.\n\nThat night, in preparation for the long sea voyage ahead, the vampire hastily loads his coffin aboard ship and waits...\n\nOnce at sea, Orlock bares his fangs and upon arrival in Wisborg, leaves behind a floating morgue. Now, preparing to feast on the citizens, the cadaveous Count, prowls the darkness as the eerie Nosferatu.",

Released on New Year's Day, it was directed by and starred Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m, alongside Hilda BorgstrÃ¶m, Tore Svennberg and Astrid Holm.[1] It is based on the novel Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness! (KÃ¶rkarlen; 1912), by Nobel-prize winning Swedish author Selma LagerlÃ¶f.\n\nThe film is notable for its special effects, its advanced (for the time) narrative structure with flashbacks within flashbacks, and for having been a major influence on Ingmar Bergman.[2]",

While the people wait in fear, one Jedi trained by Master Oram Bren will be chosen to be the future leader of Prias, a title decided by a vote of the entire population of the planet. But little do they know that one Jedi's dark secret could spell their doom.",

            "description": "Since it was decided that the \"Incredible Two Headed Transplant\" was copyrighted and my previous version of Week 7 was deleted, I took some advice and created a new presentation.\n\nThis new feature is a mini vampire festival. It has \"Grave of the Vampire\" from my original Week 7, but I included a bunch of Hammer movie trailers for various Dracula flicks. So, this is not a double feature, just some trailers, a Bugs Bunny cartoon, some nifty advertisements and \"Grave of the Vampire\"!\n\nFor those of you lucky enough to have downloaded the original Week 7, consider yourself blessed; and, the rest of you - enjoy our REVISED Shocker Internet Drive In Week 7 REDO.\n\nConfused?

He is wandering near the coast when he sees a young woman (Sandra Knight) and asks her for directions to Coldon, where he hopes to rejoin his regiment. But the woman doesn't answer, doesn't even greet him and walks away. Eventually she takes him towards the sea, where she disappears in rough water. Andre loses consciousness while trying to follow her, and is attacked by a bird and awakes in a house where an old woman (Dorothy Neumann) claims never to have seen the woman. After he leaves, he sees the woman again, and while trying to follow her, is saved by a man from certain death. Andre learns that in order to help the girl, he must go to castle of Baron Von Leppe (Boris Karloff), and when he arrives, Andre sees the woman looking out of a window. However, Baron Von Leppe is old and seems reluctant to let Andre in. He claims there's no woman in the castle, but shows Andre a painting which does indeed portray her. Andre learns that she is the Baroness, who died twenty years ago. What is the baron's secret?

Once again we invite you relive the great old days of warm summer nights (or cool fall evenings), stale popcorn, dry hamburgers, bad movies, fun cartoons and,everyone's favorite drive in activity, backseat love.\nTonight we present are presenting a black & white double feature in \"Deadland\". After an early Porky Pig cartoon, we proudly present the George A. Romero classic \"Night of the LIving Dead\", sourced from a nice print by the way (parental discreation is advised). And if that wasn't enough, we close out our show with another \"dead\" cult classic - \"Carnival of Souls\"!\n(FYI - per request!)\nOf course, as always, our feature includes the usual movie previews, drive-in advertisements and fun. So sit back, put your speaker in the car window and enjoy.\nFor more information and fun stuff, don't forget to visit our website: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/Shocker-Internet-Drive-In-1079848878843455\n or\nhttp://beatlbay7900.hostoutfitter.com/home.html",

He meets a beautiful model, Trilby, and becomes infatuated with her, but she, in turn, falls for a young artist called Billee who also loves her. One day Svengali hypnotizes Trilby to cure her headache, but also examines her upper palate and decides it is an ideal cavity for great singing. He convinces her to fake her suicide, so Billee and friends will forget her, and goes on a singing tour with her. Svengali uses his powers to make her sing wonderfully and Madame Svengali, as Trilby is now known, becomes a sensation throughout Europe. But Billee discovers the ruse and begins to follow the pair, upsetting Svengali enough to have him cancel performances too frequently, so they no longer can perform in Europe. They go to Egypt, but Billee relentlessly follows",

            "description": "\"The Sword and the Dragon\" (1960) is the Americanized version of the Russian film \"Ilya Murometz\" (1956) released by Valiant Pictures and presented by Joseph Harris and Sig Shore.The Russian original, was directed by famed fantasy film maker and animator, Aleksandr Ptushko, and was derived from Russian folklore. It was reportedly the first Russian film made in Cinemascope and 4-channel stereo sound.The Americanized version was released to television in a pan and scan, mono-only version which nonetheless is fondly remembered by American baby boomers who saw it oft-repeated on \"Million Dollar Movie\" in the Sixties.Voice-over actors in the American-version include Marvin Miller and/or Paul Frees (sources differ) and narration is by well-known news anchor, Mike Wallace.I far as I know, \"The Sword and the Dragon\" is no longer under copyright and there are at least two versions of it on Youtube, both apparently derived from the same very poor source. Research leads me to believe there was a version here on the IA which was subsequently deleted around 2008.This is the reconstructed pan and scan version with new opening credits. Excellent subtitled Russian editions of many of Ptushko's films, including this one, are available on DVD from Ruscico/Image.",

They come ashore on an island that is being used as a testing center for a scientist and agents from \"an eastern power.\" They seek to turn the people of the United States into easily controlled zombie like creatures. The agents steal Reg's boat, stranding the teens on the island. The four friends are then held captive in cages able only to speculate on their fate. Though they have already been testing the formula on convicts and drunks, the enemy scientist and agents plan to conduct final tests on the teens before they use it on the rest of America. Meanwhile, two of their friends, whom the captives had planned to meet later, search for their missing friends. After a series of suspicious encounters, they urge the corrupt sheriff to search the island where their friends are trapped.",

I'm not calling this the uncut version because the uncut version, according to wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brain_That_Wouldn%27t_Die#DVD_releases), is 85 min. long and wasn't shown in theaters. This version is widely accepted as extended)\n\nThe AVI File is Marked as DivX but is in fact an AVI with a wmv2 codec (So that it will play in wmp without a codec pack)\n\nEDIT: I have uploaded a .torrent file. Please, if you could, download it and seed for everyone so that everyone else can have a faster downloading experience.",

            "description": "The Ghoul is a 1933 British Horror film starring Boris Karloff, Cedric Hardwicke, Ernest Thesiger and Ralph Richardson, whose debut film this was. The plot centres around a Professor (Karloff) who is to be buried with an Egyptian jewel in order to attain eternal life. When the jewel is stolen by his servant, the professor rises from the dead to reclaim it.\n\nThe film, based on the play and novel by Dr. Frank King and Leonard J. Hines, was once considered to be a lost film since the original nitrate negative had succumbed to decomposition and no prints of the film were known to exist. However, an incomplete and partly decomposed Czech release print was discovered which was the only available print for several decades. Then, finally, an excellent quality print was discovered in the archives of the British Film Institute.\n\n*****NOTE ABOUT COPYRIGHT STATUS OF THIS WORK*****\nThis version is the Czech print. This item was public domain in the US due to the ommission of a copyright notice and failure to fulfill other copyright formalities. The item remains in the US public domain due to it's public domain status under UK law at the relevant date of GATT/URAA (1 January 1996) rendering it ineligible for restoration of copyright. Transitional terms of UK Copyright legislation stipulate that the copyright term for this film continues to be calculated under the terms of the 1911 UK Copyright Act. This film was released in the UK in 1933. Under the terms of the law at the time, Cinematograph Films were protected as a series of \"Photographs\" with a term of 50 years copyright from the date of publication, a \"sound recording\" with a copyright term of 50 years from recording or publication and a dramatic work of collective authorship with a copyright term of 50 calendar years from the death of the first deceased principal author or the passing of the actual calendar year of the death of the last surviving principal author. The first principle author to die was director T Hayes Hunter (1884-1944). All other principle authors died within 50 years of T Hayes Hunter. As such, under UK Copyright law the film entered the public domain at midnight on 31 December 1994.",

This is a complete rip off of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers'79, Flash Gordon'80, The Black Hole and Raiders of the Lost Ark all rolled into one astounding mess. Has a lot of stock footage lifted from old trailers for Star Wars, The Magic Sword and others; While also displaying costumes that resemble Flash Gordon's Ming, Star Wars' Darth Vader and Galactica's Cylon Centurions. Two star are defending Earth in a space battle and are shot down on a desert planet where they find a cantina full of rubber masked aliens and people living under slave conditions. There is a sort of rubber version of Robby The Robot who is the enforcer for the Ming like ruler. Many of the padded rubber costumes recall the movie Super Inframan and it has an overall similar feel. There are explosions happening everywhere the characters turn and some very strange martial arts type fight and then some living mummy's actually show up in an Indiana Jones-like cave sequence. \nNot a very good print. The sound goes out of sync in places. Sorry. There probably aren't any good prints as this is known to be an \"abandoned\" film. (Probably out of embarrassment as the Turkish film industry has come a long way since 1982). No copyright appears on this film anywhere. .",

A gang of crooks are out to stop him. This film is considered science fiction by many because the concept of television was still on the drawing boards in the 30's, but it's also a comedy. Stars Lyle Talbot, Mary Astor, Nat Pendleton, and Joyce Compton. Whether you would consider this scifi or not, you should find it entertaining anyway.",

After the group fails to secure any funding, a rich newspaper publisher's son forks over the cash and accompanies them on their monumental journey.\nThey design a cyclotram, basically a great big ugly metal boxcar with a humongous drill for a nose, ascend to the top of an extinct volcano, go down into the crater and start drilling through rock as they make their way downward. \nEvery so often, they stop for a minute to fight or to provide an opportunity for one of them to die.",

He'd appear as a mummy, Count Dracula, a deranged hunchback, and his most famous role of Waldemar Daninsky, the doomed werewolf. After directing several successful \"El Hombre Lobo\" romps for Naschy, León Klimovsky was back on hand for this undead entry, known in Spain as LA REBELION DE LAS MUERTAS. Naschy takes on two roles; an East Indian guru named Krishna and his scarred brother Kantaka, who uses some kind of voodoo to bring back the dead and haunt a redheaded British woman (Romy, who looks great in a pink nightgown) after her father gets the hatchet in the head. \n\nLike Klimovsky's DR. JEKYLL AND THE WOLFMAN, some of this film was shot on location in London, the city where it takes place in. Anyone expecting George Romero-inspired antics should look elsewhere. Klimovsky's zombies are mainly female actresses in black cloaks and blue face make-up who stroll around and grin a lot (they look something like the vamps in Andy Milligan's ultra-cheap THE BODY BENEATH). One haunting scene in which they attack a morgue attendant is somewhat reminiscent of Klimovsky's own WEREWOLF'S SHADOW (as well as a scene in the first \"Blind Dead\" film), with the bizarre image of the pasty-faced gals mutilating his neck with the rim a soda can!",

            "description": "\"Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women\" (1968) is the second of two reworkings of \"Planeta Bur,\" a Soviet sci-fi film from 1959. The first was the similarly titled, \"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\" (1962) assembled by director Curtis Harrington for producer Roger Corman.\"Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women\" was confabulated by Peter Bogdanovich using the pseudonym, Derek Thomas. Working under the dictum that American International would buy \"Planet\" if it had some women in it, he inserted new footage featuring Mamie Van Doren, a bevy of nubile cuties in white hot pants, and additional scenes from the Americanized version of another Soviet film, \"Nebo Zovet,\" (\"The Heavens Beckon\") from 1962.This film has been knocking around for years in a horribly faded version. I've attempted to upgrade it by reconstructing it from the best publicly available sources.First of all, I need to disavow the bizarre story that Pathecolor was some sort of tinting process. Pathecolor was a variant of Eastmancolor (Kodak), and was capable of stunning color. The stylish Poe adaptions by Roger Corman come to mind. Unfortunately, Eastmancolor has proven to be quite unstable over the years, losing density in its yellow and cyan layers until nothing exists but a washed out magenta. The 16mm print used for the generally available transfer, is a prime example of color fading, and of a misguided attempt to equalize its color by adding cyan.The original \"Planeta Bur\" was probably filmed in Sovcolor (really Agfacolor from the World War II era). Though not capable of the range, subtlety or consistency of Eastmancolor, it did have a pleasing and vibrant color pallet of its own.So here is a by no means perfect, but hopefully, much better presentation of \"Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women.\"Thanx and a tip o' the hat to Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Pavel Klushantsev, Mamie Van Doren, Filmgroup (for not copyrighting it!) and Robot John.",

This film is also known as \"The Gill Women\" and \"The Gill Women of Venus\". \n\nThis film began life as a Soviet-produced work. An American producer then added some new footage and changed the credits to hide the film's Soviet origin. The original film, \"Planeta Bur\", is also known as \"Cosmonauts on Venus\", \"Planet of Storms\", \"Planet of Tempests\", \"Planeta Burg\", and \"Storm Planet\". Much of the film \"Planeta Bur\" was also incorporated into the \"American\" film \"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\".\n\nThis film was shown in \"Pathe\" color, which is essentially just a method of placing color filters over a black and white film. Consequently, the color that you see is not the true color of the sets but instead represents an \"interpretation\" of a black and white original.\n\nThis film can be downloaded as a Theora file.

In the film's plot, starfish-like aliens disguised as humans travel to Earth to warn of the imminent collision of a rogue planet and Earth. As the planet rapidly accelerates toward Earth, a nuclear device is created at the last minute and destroys the approaching world.The film, directed by Koji Shima, was one of many early Japanese monster films quickly produced after the success of Toho's Godzilla in 1954. The film was loosely based on a novel by Gentaro Nakajima. After release, the film was met with negative reviews, with critics calling it \"bizarre\" and accusing it of using science fiction clichés. Warning from Space influenced many other Japanese science fiction films, such as Gorath.",

A silent feature.\n\nDick Bannister is the new field boss of the Ford Logging Company, a Canadian logging-crew during a time when conflicts with the powerful Consolidated Lumber Company, a bitter rival company, have turned bloody, like a private war. His boss, Miss Edith Ford, comes to inspect the lumberjack camp, bringing her doctor fiancÃ© with her. Dick is attacked by his rivals and left for dead. His loss of blood is so great that he needs a transfusion, but no human will volunteer, so the surgeon uses a wolf as a source of the blood. Afterwards, Dick begins having dreams where he runs with a pack of phantom wolves, and the rival loggers get killed by wolves. Soon, these facts have spread through the camp and most of the lumberjacks decide that Dick is a werewolf. (taken from Wikipedia)",

Meanwhile in South Korea, a young couple is about to get married and the tension builds when South Korea sends a space shuttle to investigate the bomb site. The earthquake makes its way to South Korea, caused by a giant monster named Yongary (inspired by a mythical creature in Korean lore). Yongary attacks Seoul and makes his way to the oil refineries where he consumes the oil. A child related to the aforementioned couple turns off the refineries' oil basins; Yonggary, enraged, starts attacking until an explosion at the refinery proves to have a chemical effect on it. The Korean Government then uses oil to draw Yonggary to a local river, and kills it with a refined version of the compound.",

It's not perfect but it's much better. Combined with the enhanced color it makes for a more enjoyable cheesy film experience.\n\nThe picture has been slightly enhanced but not much.

            "description": "This was the only film in the original Gamera series to be released to American theaters. It was originally presented in America by World Entertainment Corp. and Harris Associates, Inc. who re-named the film Gammera the Invincible. All subsequent entries in the series were released directly to television by American International Productions Television. Gammera the Invincible's American premiere was in New Orleans on December 15, 1966. Gammera the Invincible was heavily re-edited from its original Japanese version. Scenes were moved around and some were deleted completely. New footage featuring American actors was spliced in to create a more international feel and to replace scenes shot in the original cut featuring American extras with poor acting. Theses new scenes featured actors such as Albert Dekker and Brian Donlevy. The film was dubbed by Titan Productions, Inc. It features the voices of Jack Curtis and Peter Fernandez, who are best known as voices on Speed Racer and Ultraman.\n\nThe film opens with Gamera's awakening from the accidental detonation of an atomic bomb as a result of an aerial assault by American fighters on Soviet bombers caught crossing into North American airspace. Gamera wastes no time in causing a rampage of destruction, first destroying a Japanese research ship, then making its way to Japan to wreak havoc. In an attempt to stop the giant turtle, Gamera is sedated with a freezing agent on a precipice, and powerful explosives are placed at the base. The explosion knocks the monster on its back, and while it seems as though mankind has scored a victory, this is not the case: Gamera reveals its ability to fly. A second strategy, Plan Z, is devised to stop the monster, this time by baiting it into a rocket bound for Mars. The plan is successful and the Earth is safe from Gamera.",

Obwohl eine amerikanisch-japanische Koproduktion, waren es Briten, die Regie führten, das Drehbuch lieferten und die beiden Hauptrollen belegten – samt amerikanischem Akzent.\n\n\nSchnickschnack\n\nDie Briten Peter Dyneley (Larry) und Jane Hylton (Linda) waren auch im echten Leben Mann und Frau und traten in vielen ihrer Filme gemeinsam auf. Unter Dyneleys bekanntesten Sprechrollen war Jeff Tracey in der britischen Fernsehserie „Thunderbirds“ (1965–66) – auch mit amerikanischem Akzent!\n\nKurosawa-Fans werden unter der Badekappe des Tempelpriesters Shinpei Takagi erkennen, der in den Filmen „Das Schloß im Spinnwebwald“ (1957) und „Die sieben Samurai“ (1954) mitwirkte. In „The Manster“ zeichnete Takagi übrigens auch für die Tricktechnik verantwortlich.\n\nVon den 26 Namen im Vorspann blieb „The Manster“ für sieben ihr einziges Werk, darunter die Schauspieler Terri Zimmern (Tara) und Van Hawley (Ian Matthews).\n\nDie Schauspieler Jerry Ito (Aida) und Tetsu Nakamura (Suzuki) sind auch später in einem Film zusammen aufgetreten: „Mothra bedroht die Welt“ (1961).\n\nDie Werbezeile „Half Man – Half Monster“ („Halb Mann, halb Monster“) lieferte den Originaltitel „The Manster“. Für diese Fassung mit deutschen Untertiteln wurde „Die Spaltung“ in Anlehnung an „The Split“ gewählt, unter dem der englischsprachige Film in den japanischen Kinos lief. Das Wort „split“ kommt übrigens nur zweimal vor: einmal sagt es Dr. Suzuki („He might separate completely! Split into two human beings!“) und einmal steht es auf Dr. Suzukis wissenschaftlicher Darstellung des Mutationsverlaufs.",
