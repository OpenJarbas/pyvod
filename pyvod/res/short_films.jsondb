            "description": "synopsis\n\nthis short film shot in tehran, recounts the adventures of two young street musicians who play the accordion and tablas in order to earn their living. two young street musicians in tehran, a boy and a girl, have their accordion confiscated as the result of an incident while playing next to a mosque. \n\nâthe accordion is the story of humankindâs materialistic need to survive in a pretentious religion. in it, a boy is prevented from playing for reasons of religious prohibition, which he accepts in order to survive. but the main character of the film is the girl or, perhaps, in my view, the symbol of the next generation. in her ideal world she realizes manâs need for survival and decides to avoid the violence and share her small income with someone else who is also in need.â -- jafar panahi\n\n\n\nsegment of the film project \"then and now beyond borders and differences\" produced by art for the world in 2010 and based on the article 18 of the universal declaration of human rights: \"everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion\".\n\n\"i'm a director who pays attention to social aspects and what's happening around me ... 'the accordion' shows my feelings about what's happening and how i see reality,\" -- jafar panahi  \n\n\n\n\n\n*          *          * \n\ntwo children eke out their living on the streets of tehran by playing their accordion. passersby generously offer them coins, till the instrument is forcibly taken away by a man, who finds the children, a brother and sister, guilty of having played music just outside a mosque. the boy pleads to be forgiven, saying he just did not realise that he was outside a mosque. the children cry out in desperation; they need the money to buy medicines for their sick mother at home. but the man remains unmoved and disappears with the accordion into the cityâs labyrinth of lanes. \n\na little later, the children spot the man sitting in a square playing the instrument. the boy gets hold of a stone, ready to hit him with it. the girl asks the brother not to do so. and as the children inch towards the man, he continues playing music and ultimately returns the accordion without any struggle.\n\nprobably, the power of music moved the man to compassion, to a higher state of tolerance. the movie is a powerful metaphor on violence, lenience and, finally, hope.  an absolute masterpiece, i would think. and, in nine minutes, panahi shook us all up with a searing piece of truth. -- gautaman bhaskaran\n\n\n\n*          *          * \n\n\none of the most celebrated iranian and international artists compresses his storytelling and reflections in a short film that not only captures tehran today, but also serves as a metaphor on violence, tolerance and hope. it was, in fact, jafar pahaniâs vitality and courage here that sparked our passions most. \n\nhowever, the director would not have conceived this splendid âshort storyâ were it not for backing from the wonderful utopia that is the omnibus film then and now, dedicated to overcoming barriers and differences and produced by art for the world with support from the united nations. \n\nwe further await to see and applaud the accordion in its final âhome,â alongside works from other great directors, including tata amaral, fanny ardant, faouzi bensaidi, sergei bodrov, isabelle coixet, mahanat-saleh haroun, hã¼seyin karabey, masbedo, murali nair, guka omarova, idrissa ouã©draogo, abderrahmane sissako and robert wilson. -- giorgio gosetti, venice days\n\nvenice (venice days), afi (short films) \nselected filmography of jafar panahi \n\nthe accordion (2010) \noffside (2006) \ntalaye sorkh (2003) - crimson gold (2003) \nthe circle - dayereh (2000) \nthe mirror - ayneh (1997) \nardekoul (1997) \nthe white balloon - badkonake sefid (1995) \ndoust (1992) \nakharin emtehan (1992) \nkish (1991) \nyarali bashlar (1988) \n",

            "description": "\nkey early scene from the classic grindhouse roughie \"the defilers\" (1965). in contrast to the crude, amateurish new york sexploitation films (see \"olga's house of shame\" clips), this is the first hollywood roughie with a developed storyline, characters, and slick production (despite a budget of only $11,000). in other words, a low-budget film that doesn't look cheap. this also appears to be the first movie with a sexual sadist using corporal punishment (spanking) as foreplay -- as well as defiant-to-compliant masochism (on the part of the girl in this scene). shocking and groundbreaking for its time, this film solidified a formula that has been used in countless exploitation and horror films.\n\nbyron mabe is utterly convincing as a rich, misogynistic creep who lives only for \"kicks, baby, kicks!\". this includes pot smoking and rough sex in his \"secret dungeon\". the quest for kicks escalates to kidnapping an innocent swedish girl and keeping her as a sex slave.\n\nwriter/producer david f. friedman and director lee frost defined the '60s-'70s exploitation genre with ''love camp 7\" (the first nazisploitation film), \"hot spur\", \"the ramrodder\", ''ilsa, she-wolf of the ss\", et al.\n\nmabe went on to direct similar films, often with friedman, such as \"the head mistress\", \"the lustful turk\", \"space-thing\" (all 1968) and \"the adult version of jekyll and hide\" (1971).\n\nwilliam l. rose, the cinematographer, directed the roughie films \"rent-a-girl\" (1965), \"pamela, pamela you are...\" (1968), and \"the girl in room 2a\" (1973).\n\nthis is part of a series on the history of fetishism in film.  search for \"fetish film\" to see more entries.\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "the dreyfus affair (french: l'affaire dreyfus) was a political scandal that divided france in the 1890s and the early 1900s. it involved the conviction for treason in november 1894 of captain alfred dreyfus, a young french artillery officer of alsatian jewish descent. sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly having communicated french military secrets to the german embassy in paris, dreyfus was sent to the penal colony at devil's island in french guiana and placed in solitary confinement, where he was to spend almost 5 years.\ntwo years later, in 1896, evidence came to light identifying a french army major named ferdinand walsin esterhazy as the real culprit. after high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence, a military court unanimously acquitted esterhazy after the second day of his trial. the army accused dreyfus of additional charges based on false documents fabricated by a french counter-intelligence officer, hubert-joseph henry, who was seeking to re-confirm dreyfus's conviction. henry's superiors accepted his documents without full examination.\nword of the military court's framing of alfred dreyfus and of an attendant cover-up began to spread, chiefly owing to j'accuse, a vehement public open letter published in a paris newspaper in january 1898 by the notable writer émile zola. progressive activists put pressure on the government to reopen the case.\nin 1899 dreyfus was brought to rennes from guiana for another trial. the intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided french society between those who supported dreyfus (the dreyfusards), such as anatole france, henri poincaré and georges clemenceau, and those who condemned him (the anti-dreyfusards), such as hubert-joseph henry and edouard drumont, the director and publisher of the anti-semitic newspaper la libre parole. the new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence, but dreyfus was offered a pardon and set free.\neventually, all the accusations against alfred dreyfus were demonstrated to be baseless. in 1906 dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated as a major in the french army. he served during the whole of world war i, ending his service with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

            "description": "the reader's digest re-edit of \"the violent years\" for those who don't want to sit through the whole thing.  all the vital scenes in just over 7 minutes. this is the \"reefer madness\" of juvenile delinquent exploitation films.  directed by \"william morgan\" (franz eichorn) from ed wood's \"girl gang\" screenplay.  (wood gets no screen credit.) this stars first-time actress jean moorehead, a 1955 playboy playmate. the story concerns four thrill-seeking high school girls who rob gas stations and commit other crimes by night. (a story about girls who pose for playboy then sink into a life of depravity would have been far more interesting.)\n\nfirst scene: the only real gem is the lovers' lane abduction scene with bondage, humiliation, and a guy being sexually assaulted by the lusty girl gang. a highly suggestive and daring scene even though most of the \"man attack\" is off camera. astonishing for the conservative '50s and typical of ed wood -- who would go on to write explicit \"roughie\" sex novels in the '60s and '70s.\n\nnext, an amusing montage of \"so what?\" scenes. this was the cynical tag line of the film, the '50s equivalent of today's \"whatever\". \n\nthen, the silly paranoid mccarthyism subplot is revealed. it's the lamest communist conspiracy ever: school vandalism. the girls are hired by an unnamed foreign organization (but we know who they are) to trash their school, and never mind if some u.s. flags get damaged as well. notice where moorehead tosses a globe through the window. this is followed by a montage with voice-over. we see an alternate take with the globe bouncing off the wall.  this concludes with a stern lecture from a moralizing judge who suggests we return to good old-fashioned wood shed spanking to straighten these brats out. that's telling 'em, judge.",

(you may want to avert your eyes during the skinny dipping sequence.) unable to get any more film offers, she is forced to work as a nude model for cheap girlie magazines. the last session shows her in bondage with whip marks on her back to illustrate a fetishistic story. quite daring for its time. this was most likely made for independent theaters that ran seedy b-movies about drug addiction, prostitution, female wrestling, and so forth. this talky 20-minute short subject has been mercifully edited down to its essential scenes.\n\nto see more clips and trailers in this series, search for \"exploitation\", \"fetish film\", \"stag film\", \"sexploitation\" and \"nunsploitation\". other films in this series include: olga's house of shame, the defilers, the love girls, rent-a-girl, olga's girls, motel confidential, venus in furs, sweet sugar, cool it baby, all women are bad, the ramrodder, honey, women in prison and '30s french fetish films, irving klaw, bettie page, et al.",

(unfortunately, the mpeg conversion process always darkens the image for some reason.)\n\nbackground info: in the early '50s, statuesque maila nurmi was a model for assorted men's magazines (along with a young tina louise, julie newmar, et al.). in 1955-56 she shot to fame as vampira, television's first horror hostess. wood hired her for one day of shooting in 1956. her scenes were filmed in just two hours and she was paid the union minimum wage of $200. nurmi thought wood was a pathetic \"goon\" and felt the film would amount to nothing. little did she know that her small role in this insane film would be her lasting legacy.\n\nsee my other listing for \"the vampira show\" with rare clips from 1954",

(the bioscope, feb. 15, 1912)\nfilm 2\npathé comedy with max linder (orig. title: \"vive la vie de garçon\", 1908)\n'hurrah for bachelorhood' begins with a tiff between a married couple, ending in the wife putting on her hat and cloak and going home to her mother. the husband apparently is rather pleased than otherwise and prepares to thoroughly enjoy the unfamiliar freedom of a single existence, but he soon arrives at the conclusion that the wedded state has its advantages after all. as he is returning from a shopping expedition laden with a chicken and a large bundle of vegetables, he meets a lady friend and drops the chicken in his eagerness to greet her. an urchin picks up the lard and the man runs after him. further trials befall him and when his wife, acting on the advice of her mother, once more comes home, he is quite ready to make it up.

'assault' is a grotesque and sardonic exploration of the lengths to which germany has stooped in difficult times--sometimes funny, sometimes scary--suggesting the corrupting influence of money (amplified even further by the fact that this money, being counterfeit, is itself corrupt). \n\n----------\n\nreference...\n\n\"menilmontant\" [1924-25]\n\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/menilmontant1924-25",

            "description": " the cpsc data shows that babies placed in adult beds are at risk of dying from several hidden hazards including:\n\n    * entrapment between the bed and wall, or between the bed and another object.\n\n    * entrapment involving headboards, footboards or bed frames.\n\n    * soft bedding-related hazards (such as suffocation on a pillow).\n\n    * falls (sometimes into a pile of clothing or plastic, resulting in suffocation).\n\n    * overlaying of the baby by another child or adult in the bed. \n\nthe campaign will include a video news release (vnr) that will be fed to stations nationwide highlighting the hazards associated with placing babies in adult beds and safety pamphlets/posters distributed through retailers, hospitals, health departments and various grass roots organizations.\n\nacting cpsc chairman thomas moore said \"many of these tragic deaths associated with placing babies in adult beds are preventable.\"\n\nthe cpsc recommends the following safety tips to ensure that babies under 24 months sleep safely:\n\n    * don't place a baby to sleep in an adult bed.\n\n          o hidden hazard: the baby could become entrapped between the bed & wall, or in headboards, footboards, bedframes. babies could also fall or suffocate in soft bedding.\n\n    * place babies to sleep on their backs in a crib that meets current safety standards and has a firm, tight-fitting mattress. if you use a portable crib or playpen, make sure it meets current safety standards. use only the mattress or pad provided by the manufacturer.\n\n    * babies should be placed to sleep on their backs, not their stomachs.\n\n          o hidden hazard: according to the back to sleep campaign, \"babies sleeping on their stomachs seem to be more likely to succumb to sids (sudden infant death syndrome).\" \n\n    * don't place a baby to sleep on soft bedding.\n\n          o hidden hazard: the baby could suffocate. do not use soft bedding such as pillows and thick quilts and comforters for infants under 12 months old.\n\n",

what sort of people are they? we are the people, we, the women of this province.\n\n[video: women at meeting]\nnarration: the women came to kandahar to write an afghan womens bill of rights. they want what all afghans want for their country: peace and reconstruction. as muslims, they want a rule of law that is within the precepts of islam. as women, they ask that the constitution recognize their civil and human rights. 19\n\nfor afifa azim, , director of the afghan womens network, this is an historic moment. 6\n\nsot afifa azim, director, afghan womens network (in pashto) 39\n[#2, :07:53 at takriban - :08:32] about half the population in our society or any society is women, and its very necessary that women participate in the writing of the law. it will inevitably have an impact on womens lives, and if they make a contribution to it, it will be very good for women, for afghanistans reconstruction and its future.\n\nvideo: women at meeting\nnarration: the women agreed on 16 rights for the constitution to recognize. their top priorities: mandatory education through secondary school, access to adequate healthcare, and protection from violence and abuse. they asked for freedom of speech, the right to vote and hold public office. they asked for equal pay for equal work, for greater economic and personal control of their lives. 26\nwomen and the constitution script, p. 2\n\nsot sarah chayes, kandahar director, afghans for civil society (in english) 22\n[#1, :51:38 - :52:01] they had some extremely sophisticated expectations of what could at least be laid down in the law. i think they understood that the law is not necessarily going to be something that is immediately applied. but if you get it in the law, thats a basis on which you can later challenge custom and practise.\n\n[video: b-roll women in burqas getting off bus, kandahar pix w/men\nnarration: the women take the opportunity in kandahar to pray at the holiest shrine in afghanistan, kharka sharif.\nkandahar that was the center of the taliban movement, and conservative customs regarding women are still strong here. some are traditions that go back centuries, but they were enforced as if they were religious law in the taliban regime.\nsocial change comes slowly anywhere in the world, but even in kandahar there are some signs of openness in the interest of all afghans. 30\n\nmos man in kandahar (in pashto) 21\n[#2, :52:57 - :53:18] women should have as many rights as men do. they should go to school and work in offices  even in ministries. we need women as much as men to be doctors, engineers, everything. men and women should be on the same level.\n\n[video: women/streets of kandahar\nnarration: in kabul, many women share a desire for greater personal freedom and to take part in afghanistans reconstruction. the central government is setting an example by appointing some women to public office. but for ordinary women, memories of taliban excesses are still vivid, and cultural traditions are still strong. it takes courage to speak out. 21\n\nmos woman #1 in kabul (dari/pashto?) 19\n[#12, :35:28 - :35:46] i defend womens rights, and others should too. right now, the issue of women is such that theyre all sitting at home with their burqas, they dont defend their rights because they still fear the taliban and are afraid to do anything.\n\nwomen and the constitution script, p. 3\n\nmos woman #2 in kabul (in dari/pashto?) 32\n[#12, :38:01 - :38:31] we want deeds, not just words. we want to see the day when words become practise. freedom is not to uncover your head or legs. that doesnt mean anything. women should have top jobs, they should do important work. they should be given rights, the authorities should listen to their views. they should be  respected!\n\nvideo: women at conference\nnarration: at their conference in kandahar, the women looked to the writing of a new constitution as a step toward a day, when their words might become practise. 9\n\nmos masuda sultan, program director, women for afghan women (in english) 21\n[#3, :02:24 - :02:47] one of the most beautiful things about these women is that they are optimistic and hopeful, and you might ask, how can you have so much hope when this is the situation youre in?

            "description": "taken from wikipedia: the hut-sut song (a swedish serenade) is a novelty song from the 1940s with nonsense lyrics. the song was written in 1941 by leo v. killion, ted mcmichael and jack owens. the first and most popular recording was by horace heidt and his musical knights.\n\nthe lyrics state that a swedish boy skipped school to sit by a stream and sing what is purportedly a swedish folk song. the chorus goes in part:\n\n    hut-sut rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla, brawla sooit.\n\nthe song then purports to define some of the words, a boy and a girl by a river and their dreams. the song has an unusual and contagious rhythm.\n\nthe song was also recorded by various artists such as mel torme, freddy martin and spike jones. the song is of the same genre as other novelty songs of the era, such as mairzy doats and three little fishies (itty bitty poo) - all three of which were subjected to the musical arrangements of spike jones. some contend that the song was a rewriting of an unpublished missouri river song called hot shot dawson.[1]\n\nthe popularity of the song is lampooned in a 1940s film short [2]. in the film, the king's men (who also performed on fibber mcgee and molly), play young men living in a boarding house who are endlessly singing the song while getting dressed, eating dinner, playing cards, etc., until the exasperated proprietor finally has them removed to an insane asylum.\n\nthe song is featured in the movies from here to eternity, ace in the hole, a christmas story, and the 1942 version of horton hatches the egg.",

            "description": "french avant-garde cinema at its best.\n\na fine commentary by david badagnani...\n\ndimitri kirsanoff's menilmontant (1925)\n\nresearched by \n\ndavid badagnani\n\ndirected by dimitri kirsanoff (b. dorpat, estonia, march 6, 1899; d. france, february 11 1957, of a heart attack)\n\ncast: nadia sibirskaia (younger sister), yolande beaulieu (older sister), guy belmont (young man), jean pasquier, maurice ronsard.\n\nestonian-born filmmaker dimitri kirsanoff emigrated to paris with his parents in the early 1920s. there he trained as a musician, studying cello at the ecole normale de musique in paris and playing music for silent films. he quickly became associated with the circle of young avant-garde (\"impressionist\") french filmmakers, and began making his own independently produced films on tiny budgets. these stylish, original, early films earned him a considerable critical reputation and were later deemed precursors of both french \"poetic realism\" and italian neo-realism. kirsanoff's first wife, the beautiful nadia sibirskaïa (born jeanne brunet in redon, france, 1901), was the principal actress in most of his early films. (she also appeared in jean renoir's famous crime of m. lange (1935).) kirsanoff's second wife, monique kirsanoff (b. 1913) is the editor of numerous french films.\n\nmenilmontant (1925), kirsanoff's second film, is also his best known. (his first film, l'ironie du destin, completed in 1923, is now lost). kirsanoff not only directed, but co-photographed, edited, and produced the film for his own company. menilmontant was filmed during the winter of 1924-25, primarily on location in menilmontant, a poor working class suburb on the eastern edge of paris which gives the film its name. originally entitled les cents pas (the hundred steps), the film was at first rejected by paris film distributors. it was subsequently picked up by film presenter jean tedesco for the second season of his series at the vieux-colombier theater, and came to be known as menilmontant. kirsanoff's film helped assure the success of the vieux-colombier and soon became a major film on the cine-club and specialized film circuit.\n\nmenilmontant is in many ways a striking film, and has been described as \"une oevre presque parfaite\" (\"a nearly perfect work\") (georges sadoul, le cinema francais, 1962). its story is told entirely in images, without the use of explanatory intertitles; kirsanoff was among the very rare filmmakers of the silent era to attempt this. the film makes use of techniques such as montage, hand-held camera, ultra-rapid montage, and superposition to achieve the elusive, transcendent quality of \"photogenie\" so sought after by the french impressionist film directors of the era. menilmontant, thus, comes closer to poetry than to narrative prose.\n\nafter menilmontant, kirsanoff continued his experiments in film, most notably with brumes d'automne (autumn mists) (1929), and rapt (1934), made in switzerland, which featured the use of \"contrapuntal sound,\" with music by arthur honegger. with the coming of sound and his separation from sibirskaïa in 1939, kirsanoff lost personal artistic control of his work and had to resign himself to working on mediocre commercial films and sponsored documentaries.\n\npointless orchestra's score makes use of fragments from the original film score to menilmontant (the composer's identity is unknown), the only surviving copy in the u.s. of which is located in the special collections of the library at the university of wisconsin, madison. many thanks to university of wisconsin senior academic librarian geri laudati for her generosity in allowing us use of the score for this performance.\n\nquotes about menilmontant:\n\n\"a flurry of hand-held camera shots, incisive montages and elliptical progressions.\" (geoff brown, monthly film bulletin, 1981)\n\n\"...one of the greatest experimental films--an exquisite, poetic 40-minute movie that is one of the least known masterpieces of the screen...the extraordinary editing is, at first, confusing and upsetting and, finally, dazzling...the performance by nadia sibirskaïa as the younger of the two [sisters] is surpassingly beautiful. in one scene, she is seated on a park bench next to an old man who surreptitiously shares his food with her--it's as great as anything in chaplin.\" (pauline kael, 5001 nights at the movies: a guide from a to z, 1984)\n\n\"d. kirsanoff montre, au cours de ces films, des qualites extremement interessantes par leur tonalite impressionniste et pathetique qui comptent parmi les realisations les plus caracteristiques de l'epoque (l'encyclopédie du cinema, ed. roger boussinot, 1967)\n\narticles by dimitri kirsanoff:\n1924 \"pour et contre le film sans texte.\" cinea-cine-pour-tous 17 (15 july 1924), 8.\n1925 \"les mysteres de la photogenie.\" cinea-cine-pour-tous 39 (15 june 1925), 9.\n1926 \"les problemes de la photogenie.\" cinea-cinãe-pour-tous 62 (1 june 1926), 9-10.\n\n \ndimitri kirsanoff filmography:\n\n1923 l'ironie du destin (the irony of fate) (lost)\n1925 menilmontant\n1926 sylvie destin (destins)\n1927 sables\n1929 brumes d'automne (autumn mists)\n1931 les nuits de port said\n1933 rapt - la separation des races (english titles: the mystic mountain and the kidnapping) (switzerland)\n1935 les berceaux (short)\n1936 visages de france (documentary)\n1936 la fontaine d'aréthuse (short)\n1936 la jeune fille au jardin (short)\n1937 franco de port\n1938 la plus belle fille du monde ne peut donner que ce au'elle a\n1938 l'avion de minuit\n1939 quartier sans soleil (kirsanoff's last film to feature sibirskaïa) (release delayed until 1945)\n1946 deux amis (short)\n1949 faits divers a paris (short)\n1950 arrière saison (short)\n1951 la mort du cerf - une chasse à courre à villiers-cotterets (short)\n1952 le témoin de minuit\n1955 le craneur (la vallée de paradis)\n1956 ce soir les jupons volent (tonight the skirts fly)\n1956 miss catastrophe",
