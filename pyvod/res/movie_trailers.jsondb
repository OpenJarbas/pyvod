            "description": "Sidney Lumet's first effort as a film director, 12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 Studio One television series episode of the same name and covers the deliberations of a jury at the trial of a young man from the slums for premeditated murder.\nThe film begins with the presiding judge giving instructions to the jurors, reminding them that the verdict must be unanimous, that the sentence in case of a guilt will be capital punishment, and that they must be absolutely certain of the defendant's guilt or deem him not guilty if they have reasonable doubts. After deliberations start, what first seemed to be an open and shut case of blatant guilt becomes more complicated when a lone juror emits doubts about the defendants guilt and discomfort with making a quick decision. The twelve jurors then find themselves having to re-examine whether the evidence is as strong as the prosecution made it out to be, how seriously they are taking their role in this process and whether personal prejudice stands in the way of reaching a fair verdict.\n\nExternal links:\nIMDB entry\nAmerican Film Institute entry\nWikipedia entry",

At times the actors appear to be stunned by the juvenile dialog they're forced to spout. As for production values, the astronauts' acceleration couches are poolside recliners. You've been warned.\n\nNOTE: The authors were Fred Gebhardt (story) and De Witt Bodeen (screenplay). Both were adults at the time. Gebhardt also wrote the story for \"The Phantom Planet,\" which at least has the virtue of being entertainingly bad. It's available here at IA.\n\nCAST NOTE: Silent film star Francis X Bushman's next feature film role would be in \"The Phantom Planet.\" He continued acting in films and on television until 1966.",

            "description": "Rare trailer (albeit incomplete) for the notoriously awful \"Devil Monster\" (1946) with stock film of topless South Seas native girls. A Mexican-American co-production released originally in 1935 as \"The Sea Fiend\" and \"The Great Manta\". Eleven years later it was re-edited with more nude scenes and reissued as \"Devil Monster\", most likely for use on the adults-only roadshow circuit.\n\nAfter that are clips from \"Maniac\" (1934) with perhaps the earliest use of nudity in an exploitation film. An astonishingly bizarre and lurid horror movie with terrible over-acting, nude scenes, and an obvious rape-in-progress sequence (too dark for my mpeg converter) that amazingly escaped censorship. Plus a totally gratuitous scene of floozies in skimpy lingerie that has nothing to do with the story. The last bit shows a nice fantasy transition special effect and superimposed scenes from the 1922 silent film \"Witchcraft Through the Ages\" to illustrate the mad scientists insanity.\n\nThe inclusion of numerous title cards with clinical descriptions of mental illnesses gave this film a pseudo-scientific documentary appearance. Thus, the pretense of being an educational film made it possible to screen it, with all its outrageous scenes intact, on the exploitation circuit. \n\nDirector Dwain Esper was pretty much the Ed Wood of the '30s. He gave the world the exploitation classics \"Narcotic\" (1933), \"Marihuana\" (1936), and \"Sex Madness\" (1938) -- the latter two also have nude scenes and are available in this archive along with the complete \"Maniac\" and \"Devil Monster\".",

            "description": ".\n(Part 2 of 3) - Theater trailer for \"Olga's Girls\" (1964), sequel to the boring \"White Slaves of Chinatown\". Here diabolical S&M style torments are actually shown on screen for the first time. As the narration says: \"Disgustingly true. No symbolism, just realism.\"  The stylized sadism, whipping and breast torment looks mild today, but was a sensation back then. A new wave of roughie exploitation films would copy this formula countless times.  \n\nNext are \"Olga's Dance Hall Girls\" (1969) with an occult theme, and the phony \"Mondo Oscenita\" (1966).  \"Mondo\" claims to consist of shocking scenes banned from other pictures. The trailer shows it has parts from \"Olga's House of Shame\" (1964) and other sexploitation films that were not censored.\n\nThe writer/producer George Weiss is best known for producing Ed Wood's \"Glen or Glenda?\" Weiss added risque fetishistic bondage and whipping scenes to Wood's dream sequence (also posted at this site). Weiss was influenced by the bondage stag loops of Irving Klaw.\n\nWilliam L. Rose, the cinematographer, went on to direct several roughie films with whipping and spanking scenes such as Rent-a-Girl (1965), Pamela, Pamela you are... (1968), and The Girl in Room 2a (1973).\n\nTo see more clips and trailers in this series, search for \"exploitation\", \"fetish film\", \"stag film\", \"sexploitation\" and \"nunsploitation\". Other films in this series include: The Defilers, The Love Girls, Rent-A-Girl, Motel Confidential, Venus in Furs, Sweet Sugar, Cool It Baby, All Women are Bad, The Ramrodder, Honey, women in prison and '30s French fetish films, Irving Klaw, Bettie Page, et al.",

            "description": "Part 1 of 3: Promos for the notorious Olga exploitation films. \"White Slaves of Chinatown\" (1964), the trailer is more exciting than this tepid first film in the series. The first of a new \"roughie\" genre that soon replaced nudie-cutie adult films in grind-house theaters. The producer/writer was influenced by the 1950s Irving Klaw fetish stag films with Bettie Page et al. \n\n\"Olga's House of Shame\" (1964) third, and best, in the series with Audrey Campbell's last appearance as Olga. Crudely made and lacking live audio (just documentary style narration and some badly looped dialog), Still, this pulls out the stops with never-before-seen S&M fetish elements including nipple torture, sadistic spanking, breast whipping, pony girl discipline, and the use of a perforated drool gag.  Before this film, one could only see that sort of thing in a stag film.\n\nThe last trailer is for \"Mme. Olga's Massage Parlor\" (1965), 4th in the series and only slightly related to the others. This features health club exercise equipment adapted for tormenting unruly white slave prostitutes. \n\nThe producer George Weiss is best known for producing Ed Wood's \"Glen or Glenda?\" Weiss added risque fetishistic bondage and whipping scenes to Wood's dream sequence (also posted at this site). Joseph P. Mawra directed the series.\n\nWilliam L. Rose, the cinematographer, went on to direct several roughie films with whipping and spanking scenes such as Rent-a-Girl (1965), Pamela, Pamela you are... (1968), and The Girl in Room 2a (1973).",

A typically nasty, misogynistic, sex-and-violence crime drama inspired by the hard-boiled film noir of the '40s and '50s.

She tries to get rid of it, but it pops up again and tortures her. \n\nThe image is that of a dark and remote and possibly not so bad character; she is a stranger who polishes her finger nail and dyes her hair in a blond hue, and leave Aida no peace of mind. \n\n\n\nBut the woman's end is quite real and for the first time Aida consciously experiences doubt. She realizes that beauty and pain are two inseparable ingredients and finally Aida begins to focus on a hope which she has witnessed for one moment in her parents faces. \n\nThen she feels in herself the hope for a future whose nature she does not realize. She experiences a profound moment of comprehension and that seems to be sufficient. \n\nCast: Khatereh Asadi, Ehteram Boroumand, Sharareh Dolat Abadi, Shahrokh Foroutanian, Soufi Kiani, Elham Pavenezhad",

It is centered on the car in a way which is no longer relevant for many if not most American teenagers. The  following of a radio disc jockey also is a relic of the past.\n\nTRIVIA: Charles Martin Smith's Vespa crash wasn't scripted. It was real. Universal withheld the release of \"American Graffiti\" for six months because they thought it would be a flop. Were they ever wrong! Its initial 1973 release earned over $119,000,000, and it's gone on to earn more millions ever since.",

An Inconvenient Tax sheds light on one of Americaâs messiest problems â a fundamentally broken tax code that affects every part of people's lives. With the U.S. Congress making over 16,000 changes to the tax code in the last two decades alone, many Americans want something better, but few know where to start. This feature-length documentary film reveals the many ways Congress uses the tax code to achieve political goals that have nothing to do with raising revenue. It also tackles the controversial issue of tax reform through a non-partisan presentation of U.S. tax history and current proposals to fix the code. In a time when America faces fiscal crisis, An Inconvenient Tax brings a crucial exploration of the tax code to the big screen.\n\nhttp://www.aninconvenienttax.com",

ADHD, Mexican masked wrestlers and serial killers all collide in 12 stylised and highly original parts.\n\nThe film was made with a cheap HDV camera, a DSLR with no movie capability and a brand new 2010 iPod Touch with HD movie recording. The music is a collage of styles, ancient synthesisers, folk music, ambient sounds and music by Anonymous Bosch, The Sinatra Test and other undiscovered and volatile talents.\n\nThe music for the trailer is by The Sinatra Test and is played on an antique EMS synthesiser from about 1973. The video was shot by me while driving with the iPod Touch and then edited and colour graded in Final Cut Pro to resemble old Two-Strip Technicolor.\n\nThe film is scheduled for release in 2011. As each of the 12 sections is completed it will be uploaded here to Archive.org, as will video diaries and making of segments illustrating the techniques used when making the film.\n\nWatch this space.",

Shot on location in Ireland, England and Germany, this stunningly  beautiful film has been rated by the Village Voice, Sight & Sound and Time as one of the greatest films ever made. Don't miss it. The chances of a film this visually magnificent ever being made again are slim to none.\n\nUnfortunately this 4:3 cropped trailer misses the point and doesn't begin to do the film justice.",

Flames of Atoma \n6. Astray in the Atmosphere \n7. Blasted by the Atomic Eye \n8. Invisible Menace \n9. Video Springs a Trap \n10. Menace of the Mystery Metal \n11. Weapons of Destruction \n12. Robot Rocket \n13. Mystery of Station X \n14. Vengeance of Vultara \n15. Video vs. Vultara \n\nTRIVIA: No worries about a silly romantic subplot. There are no females in Captain Video's universe.

This film  also touches on the dispute over the Rockefeller Center mural painted by Diego Rivera, an avowed communist. Keep in mind this is a movie. Some facts and situations are altered for dramatic effect. Real people and fictional characters are portrayed.\n\nLike the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) the Federal Theater Project was part of the WPA (Works Projects Administration), a federal umbrella agency set up during the Depression to provide government-paid work and training for the unemployed in a wide variety of fields. Contrary to any revisionist propaganda you might have heard, it actually worked as an emergency measure; and went on to change the face of America for the better in countless ways, including roads where there had been none, new schools, new municipal buildings, national parks facilities and rural electrification to mention just a few.

Multiple oscar winner including best actor (Burt Lancaster) and best supporting actress (Shirley Jones). Adaptation of the best-selling novel by Sinclair Lewis.\n\nNOTE: This film makes several strong allusions to the life of Aimee Semple McPherson, a '20s evangelist and media star who fell from grace after her divorce and several bizarre incidents including her supposed kidnapping. There also were accusations of extramarital affairs, which were never proved. She is credited with founding the first megachurch.",

Both were made in New York and share the same personnel. \"Venus in Furs\" (1967) directed by Joseph Marzano stars Barbara Ellen. The first film inspired by the famous Sacher-Masoch novel. Contains foot fetishism, animal role playing, and other oddities.\n\n\"Cool it Baby\", directed by Lou Campa, is written by Joe Marzano and also stars Barbara Ellen. More of a \"roughie\" that copies the \"Olga's House of Shame\" (1964) formula. A sleazy nudie photographer drugs girls and forces them to make adult films and take part in private sex club orgies. It has the usual ingredients: abduction, bondage, spanking, torture, and degradation. \n\nTo see more clips and trailers in this series, search for \"exploitation\", \"fetish film\", \"stag film\", \"sexploitation\" and \"nunsploitation\". Other films in this series include: Olga's House of Shame, The Defilers, The Love Girls, Olga's Girls, Motel Confidential, Venus in Furs, Sweet Sugar,  All Women are Bad, The Ramrodder, Honey, women in prison and '30s French fetish films, Irving Klaw, Bettie Page, et al.",

            "description": "Synopsis\n\nMickey Rourke stars in this story of the passionately mystical life of St. Francis of Assisi. \n\nAmid the tumult and savagery of 13th-century Italy, Francesco, the decadent son of a wealthy merchant, experiences a stunning religious awakening. \n\nHe renounces his life of debauchery and begins an all-consuming quest for spiritual purity. Italian writer-director Liliana Cavani's docudrama also stars Helena Bonham Carter as Chiara (St. Clare).\n\nTold in flashback, the film relates Francis of Assisiâs evolution from rich manâs son to religious humanitarian and eventually to full-fledged saint. \n\nFrancesco (1989) - Trailer\n\n\n\nFrancesco was based on Hermann Hesseâs Francis of Assisi, which director Liliana Cavani had previously filmed in 1966. \n\nThe Saint and founder of the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor is played by Mickey Rourke, and his inspiration, the woman who later became Saint Clare, is played by Helena Bonham Carter. \n\nRaised as the pampered son of a merchant, Francis goes off to war only to return with a profound horror for the society which generated such suffering. \n\nIn one scene, as an act of renunciation, he strips himself of his fine clothing in front of his father and leaves the house naked and barefoot, joining the lepers and beggars in the poor section of town. \n\nThe film follows with a series of episodes from the saintâs life rather than a coherent narrative, following up until his final days when he receives the stigmata, or wounds similar to those on the body of Jesus at the crucifixion. -- allmovieguide\n\nFrancesco (1989) - The Movie\n\n\n\nThe film won three awards and was nominated for a fourth. Danilo Donati won the 1989 David di Donatello Award for Best Production Design, and the 1989 Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon also for Best Production Design. \n\nFabio Bussotti won the Syndicate's Best Supporting Actor Award. Director Liliana Cavani was nominated for the Golden Palm at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival\n\n\n\nCast: Mickey Rourke, Helena Bonham Carter, AndrÃ©a FerrÃ©ol, Nikolaus Dutsch, Peter Berling, Hanns Zischler, Mario Adorf, Paolo Bonacelli, Fabio Bussotti",

Multiple Golden Globe winner (4) including best foreign film, best director, best actor and best screenplay.\n\nTRIVIA: Approximately 295,000 extras appear in the funeral scene. 200,000 were volunteers. 94,560 were paid under contract. John Ratzenberger (Cliff from \"Cheers\") appears in a minor role, however his voice is dubbed by an unnamed actor. One of the young toughs who insult Gandhi on a South African street is Daniel Day-Lewis.",

Small-scale organic farmers and csa members from around the South Puget Sound region share their views on the present reality of small-scale farming and its impact on farmers, consumers, and the local community as a whole. With issues of sustainability and food security coming to the fore throughout North America and beyond, Growing Awareness illustrates the importance of local small farms to a community and critiques the emergence of an organic-industrial complex as well as the modern corporate-controlled and government-subsidized global food system.",

Under the name Cleo Nova, she did The Love Merchant, The Sex Cycle, et al.  As Marie Lamont she was in the Michael Findlay \"Flesh\" trilogy: A Taste of Flesh, The Touch of her Flesh, and The Curse of Her Flesh.\n\nThis film evokes a sleazy under-the-boardwalk carny atmosphere and was apparently filmed at Coney Island, New York. This has all the expected ingredients: simulated sex, violence, sweaty perverts, lesbians, showgirls, plus some amusing voice-over narration.\n\nThe cinematographer, C. Davis Smith, also directed the equally sordid grind house nudie \"All My Men\". See the trailer for that film on this archive.\n\nThis is part of a series on vintage underground cinema.

            "description": "Cinema is not a dream or a fantasy. It is life. -- Jean-Luc Godard\n\nCannes (In Competition), London (Gala), New York (Closing Night)\n\nIn Praise of Love (French: Ãloge de l'amour) (2001) is a French film directed by Jean-Luc Godard. The black-and white and colour drama was shot by Julien Hirsch and Christophe Pollock. \nGodard has famously stated that, \"A film should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order\". This aphorism is illustrated by In Praise of Love.\n\nSynopsis\n\nSomeone we hear talking â but whom we do not see â speaks of a project which describes the four key moments of love: meeting, physical passion, arguments and separation, making up. \n\nThis is told through three couples. Young, adult and old. We do not know if the project is for a play, a film, a novel or an opera. \n\nThe author of the project is always accompanied by a kind of servant. -- Cannes Film Festival \n\nCast: Bruno Putzulu, Cecile Camp, Jean Davy, FranÃ§oise Verny, Audrey Klebaner, JÃ©rÃ©mie Lippmann, Claude BaigniÃ¨res, Ludovic Berthillot, YsÃ© Tran, Marceline Loridan Ivens \n",

            "description": "\"Go ahead! Kiss me! Forget you're married to my sister.\" (tagline).\n\nA daring romantic melodrama for 1942 that stands up exceptionally well in 2016. It's justly praised for oscar-worthy performances by Davis and de Havilland and John Huston's dynamic direction. Soap opera raised to its highest level by a skillful adaptation of Ellen Glasgow's best-selling novel.\n\nTRIVIA: This film has a mixed reputation regarding US race relations. The following is quoted from IMDB:\n\"Warner Bros. was named to the Honor Roll of Race Relations of 1942 because of its dignified portrayal of African-Americans in this film. However, scenes in which Ernest Anderson's's character was treated in a friendly fashion were cut for showings in the strictly segregated American South to avoid offending those viewers. The film was initially disapproved for export by the Office of Censorship in Washington, DC, because it suggests that the Negro's testimony would be totally disregarded by the jury when it was disputed by a white person, which, in the South at the time and for many years afterwards, was true.\"\n\nCAST NOTE: Walter Huston also appeared uncredited in John Huston's \"The Maltese Falcon.\"",

The screenplay's courtroom dialog is taken directly from the trial transcripts. Adapted from the long-running (805 performances) Tony Award winning play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee.\n\nWHO'S REALLY WHO: Spencer Tracy's character (Henry Drummond) is really the famous trial lawyer Clarence Darrow. Fredric March's character (Matthew Brady) is really the three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. Gene Kelly's character (E. K. Hornbeck) is really the iconoclast Baltimore journalist H. L. Mencken. Dick York's character (Bertram Cates) is really the accused teacher John Scopes.\n\nTRIVIA: The first in-flight movie shown on Trans-World Airlines.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE: That Fredric March wasn't even nominated for the best actor oscar is just one of the reasons I ignore the oscars.",

Either way, Peter gets what (he thinks!) he wants .... a really juicy newspaper story.\n\nStars: Clark Gable, and Claudette Colbert",

Christopher Lee still dignifies the role in spite of the poorer production values of this title. But there's even worse to come: \"The Castle of Fu Manchu\"(1969) (mostly edited out of earlier films footage) which will strike the last nail on the coffin of the poor asian mad scientist.\n\nNext appearance of Fu Manchu on the screen: Peter Sellers' very last film which is not a so good spoof, by the way: \"The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu\" (1980). Has he not shoot this one, the weak-hearted comedian might have survived a bit longer. Sad, isn't it?\n\nThere's not much chance Fu Manchu will ever appear on screen again. He is SO politically incorrect on nowadays standards, isn't he?\nNotice that the U.S. release didn't even bother to bank on Fu Manchu's name. It simply looks like an ordinary horror-adventure film.\n\nmore info on http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062741/",

Tre personaggi, tre storie in bilico tra \"normale\" ed \"estremo\" per raccontare un unico territorio, le Langhe, universalmente riconosciute come uno dei luoghi piÃ¹ belli d'Italia. Qui la coesistenza tra uomo e ambiente ha raggiunto i suoi massimi livelli: da una terra apparentemente aspra e arcigna l'uomo ha saputo ricavare eccellenze enogastronomiche, le colline appaiono come disegnate nella perfezione geometrica delle vigne, il paesaggio modellato attrae frotte di turisti e di recente Ã¨ stato candidato a diventare \"Patrimonio dell'UmanitÃ  Unesco\". Ciononostante, le Langhe non sono rimaste immuni dai processi di trasformazione economica e paesaggistica. L'urbanizzazione, la cementificazione, il progressivo abbandono delle aree e dei mestieri meno redditizi rischiano di trasformare gran parte del territorio delle Langhe nell'ennesimo tassello di quella che in \"Langhe Doc\" Giorgio Bocca definisce \"l'Italia dei capannoni\".\nQuelle di Maria Teresa, Silvio e Mauro sono storie di chi ha intravisto un futuro che non gli piaceva e lo ha rifiutato. Piccole sfide in cui tuttavia Ã¨ possibile intravedere una dimensione ben piÃ¹ ampia; sfide ancora aperte, non ancora del tutto vinte e che forse non lo saranno mai:loro si muovono in una direzione, il monto in un'altra, del tutto opposta.\n\n\"In the short space of my long life, Italy has changed in a terrifying way.\nIt's all a race against time, we have to become civilized\nbefore the disaster is complete.\nWe must see if we'll arrive in time to save this landscape,\nI think we've already largely destroyed it.\nGiorgio Bocca in \"Langhe Doc\"\n\nSynopsis\nMaria Teresa, who thought in life he would do anything but that, has taken over his father's winery and now produces excellent Barolo and Nebbiolo wines, with the same stubborn respect for tradition; Silvio was a tiler, has left a lucrative job and now makes traditional cheeses in a remote village, with his family and fifty sheep; Mauro was employed as a storekeeper in a supermarket, he has been fired and has decided to start self-producing and selling handmade, artisanal pasta.\nThree characters, three stories poised between \"normal\" and \"extreme\" to describe Langhe, a unique territory, universally recognized as one of the most beautiful places in Italy.\nHere the coexistence between man and environment has reached its highest levels: man has been capable to make gastronomic excellences out of a seemingly harsh land man,; in the geometric perfection of the vineyards, the hills appear as designed, the shaped landscape attract droves of tourists and is a fresh candidate for Unesco World Heritage.\nNevertheless, Langhe have not remained immune from the processes of economic growth and landscape transformation. Urbanization, overbuilding, abandonment of the less profitable areas and trades: these elements risk to transform Langhe in just another piece of what in \"Langhe Doc\" Giorgio Bocca calls \"Italy of warehouses\"\nThose of Maria Theresa, Silvio and Mauro are stories of people who have seen a future they did not like and have refused it. Their challenges are still open, they're not yet fully met and perhaps they never will: they move in one direction, the world moves in another one, quite the opposite.\n\n\nUna produzione Stuffilmcreativeye\nhttp://www.stuffilm.com\nstuffilm@gmail.com\n\nMusic:\nAvec4 - Messaggi - Theme\nCompania dij Musicant d'Alba - Quand che iera giovo (CCommons)\n\nhttp://www.langhedoc.it\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/LangheD...\nhttp://twitter.com/langhedoc_movie\nprenotazione/booking: http://www.produzionidalbasso.com/pdb_489.html",

Kubrick replaced the book's intense eroticism with suggestive intimacy which was all the 1960 censors would allow, and other major changes were made to the plot. Nevertheless it's a worthwhile landmark film with good performances, even if it isn't \"Lolita.\"\n\nCAST NOTE: Sue Lyon's feature film debut.\n\nTRIVIA: Being under 21 at the time, Sue Lyon wasn't allowed to attend the UK premiere. In later years Stanley Kubrick said he regretted making \"Lolita.\"",

            "description": "LÃ©olo (1992)\nSynopsis\n\nLÃ©olo is a 1992 film by Quebecois director Jean-Claude Lauzon.\n\nThrough poetic words and a vivid imagination that we come to appreciate in the sophisticated narration, a boy dreams away the grinding poverty and emotional traumas of his life in a Montreal tenement slum. \n\n \n\nMontreal's best known enfant terrible, writer-director Jean-Claude Lauzon, creates a visionary yet profoundly disturbing masterpiece about a young boy's rites-of-passage into adult life. \n\nLyricism and poetry sit cheek-to-jowl with images of misery, madness and perversion in a controversial merging of the sacred and the profane. \n\n \n\nLauzon occasionally has gutter sensibilities - the notorious sex with a cat scene - but he creates a parallel universe for the boy that is staggeringly beautiful. \n\n\n\nIn the end, this is an extraordinarily personal film that speaks to Lauzon's own vision of the world, his world. -- http://www.canoe.ca/ \n\nCast: Maxime Collin, Ginette Reno, Denys Arcand, Pierre Bourgault, Julien Guiomar, Giuditta Del Vecchio\n\nCannes (In Competition), Toronto (Opening Night): Best Canadian Feature Film - Special Jury Citation, New York\n\nJean-Claude Lauzonâs highly praised film tells the strange story of LÃ©olo, a young boy from MontrÃ©al. Told from LÃ©oloâs point-of-view, the film depicts his family of lunatics and LÃ©oloâs attempts to deal with them. \n\nNot one individual in the boyâs life is well adjusted. His brother, after being beaten up, spends the film bulking up on growth protein. The grandfather hires half-naked girls to bite off his toenails and, in a brutal rage, almost kills LÃ©olo. \n\nAs he witnesses his family decay around him, LÃ©olo retreats into himself and the fantasy world he has constructed. In response to the weirdness of his daily life, LÃ©olo creates a little mental mayhem of his own which Lauzon renders in an amazing series of free-form, surreal images. \n\nEventually, this precarious balance of reality and fantasy cracks and LÃ©olo is hospitalized after attempting to murder his grandfather. The score by Tom Waits underscores the narrative arc of LÃ©oloâs breakdown. \n\nOn its release, the film won numerous awards including the International Fantasy Film Award for Best Director (1992) and a Genie Award for Best Original Screenplay (1992). -- allmovie guide     \n\n\n\nAbout this movie\n\nTitle: LÃ©olo (1992)\nDirected by: Jean-Claude Lauzon\nDate of birth: 29 September 1953, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\nDate of death: 10 August 1997, Kuujjuaq, QuÃ©bec, Canada\nWriting credits: Jean-Claude Lauzon\nMusic: Tom Waits\n\nYear: 1992\nCountry: Canada | France \nLanguage: French\nColor: Color\nRuntime: 107 min. \nSearch\n\nSearch Online Film\nHome:\n  \n \nAbout this movie\n\nTitle: LÃ©olo (1992)\nDirected by: Jean-Claude Lauzon\nDate of birth: 29 September 1953, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\nDate of death: 10 August 1997, Kuujjuaq, QuÃ©bec, Canada\nWriting credits: Jean-Claude Lauzon\nMusic: Tom Waits\n\nYear: 1992\nCountry: Canada | France \nLanguage: French\nColor: Color\nRuntime: 107 min. \nSearch\n\nOnline Film Home\n\n",

Dell'uomo non si vede mai il viso: Ã¨ a petto nudo e l'immagine si sofferma sulle mani, sulla tastiera, sul tatuaggio.\nLa ragazza che sta chattando con lui Ã¨ giovane, desiderosa di forti emozioni. Affida al mondo un'immagine di sÃ¨ forte e decisa: l'energia e la decisione dei suoi modi di fare fanno da contrappunto all'innocenza dei suoi occhi. \nNella stanza accanto alla sua c'Ã¨ una tele accesa sulla finale dell'Italia ai campionati mondiali. Il padre sta guardando la partita, ignorando la figlia che, nell'altra stanza, sta per accettare una notte di sesso con uno sconosciuto. Infondo, anche la figlia gli Ã¨ sconosciuta. Ma delle tattiche dell'Italia quel padre sa tutto.\nAnche nella stanza dove sta chattando l'uomo col tatuaggio la tele Ã¨ accesa sulla partita. Ma lui ignora cosa stia accadendo nel rettangolo di gioco. Il volume Ã¨ azzerato. \nI due si parlano tramite un computer e un interfaccia chat su internet. Lui Ã¨ abile con le parole e la convince ad incontrarlo. Quella sera stessa, nel nulla assurdo di una cittÃ Â  vuota, svuotata dalla partita di pallone. Incontro d'amore nel vuoto. \nLei lo vuole eccitare perchÃ¨ il gioco tra loro le piace, e gli lascia intravedere il suo giovane corpo: potenza della webcam. Lui le scrive che Ã¨ molto eccitante guardarla, ma in realtÃ Â  pare freddo e meccanico, contraltare paradossale della vitalitÃ Â  della ragazza.\nSi danno appuntamento. Si vedranno entro un'ora. Alla fine della partita. \nDUE storie che si incrociano dando vita a TRE imprevedibili destini...",

Its basic premise would be repeated in the episodic, all-star comedy \"We're Not Married.\" (1952)\n\nTRIVIA: The first American film to feature a pizzeria, although a pizza isn't actually shown. IMDB states this was Hitchcock's only comedy. Of course this isn't true. In 1955 Hitch directed the black comedy, \"The Trouble With Harry,\" about a corpse that refuses to stay buried. Its trailer is in this collection.",

Beginning with details of her doomed relationship with an Iranian-born Australian and their plan to relocate to Adelaide, she recounts her struggle to work as an actress under Iranâs current regime, her hope for a future ultimately dashed by the devastating discovery of her illness, and her need to âescapeâ the only home she has ever known. Set against the backdrop of Tehranâs thriving arts culture, and framed through a series of artful and dramatic flashback sequences, poet-turned-filmmaker Granaz Moussavi boldly registers the trials of a modern woman struggling to flourish in Iranâs contemporary political climate.\n\nAbout the Director\nGranaz Moussavi was born in Tehran, Iran in 1974. She received a degree in Screen Studies from Flinders University and a postgraduate degree in Film Editing from the Australian Film Television and Radio School. She is the author of four collections of avant-garde poetry and has directed and edited several short films and documentaries. My Tehran For Sale is her first feature film.\n\nPrincipal Cast\n\t\n\n \n\nMarzieh\nSaman\nSadaf\nNiloufar\nInterviewer\n\t\n\nMarzieh Vafamehr\nAmir Chegini\nAsha Mehrabi\nMobina Karimi\nSandy Cameron\n\nCrew\n\t \n\nDirector\nWriter\nProducers\nCinematograher\nEditor\nSound\nMusic\n\n \n\t\n\nGranaz Moussavi\nGranaz Moussavi\nJulie Ryan, Kate Croser, Granaz Moussavi\nBonnie Elliott\nBryan Mason\nTom Heuzenroeder, Yadollah Najafi\nMohsen Namjou ",

Directed and produced by Roger Corman. The DVD is unrated. (a.k.a. \"Homecoming Night\").\n\nTRIVIA: Partially shot in an old Woolworth store converted into a makeshift studio.

Adapted from a novel by ex-aeronautical engineer Nevil Shute. (a.k.a. \"No Highway\")\n\nPOST SCRIPT: This 1951 film and the 1948 novel on which it was based proved to be tragically prophetic, when the design defect they mentioned caused the loss of two de Havilland Comet airliners in 1954.",

            "description": "Choice clips (and trailer) from \"Olga's House of Shame\" (1964) third, and best, in the exploitation series starring Audrey Campbell. This highly influential New York grindhouse film launched the new wave of \"roughie\" sexploitation.  Designed to be the opposite of the colorful \"nudie-cuties\", roughies added sex and sadism to film-noir crime-dramas in stories about depraved psychos who abduct women, white slavery rings, prostitution and drugs. \n\nThis film has all of those elements. The first full-length feature to show fetishes such as sadistic adult spanking, human pony training, and various S&M devices and practices used to control slave girls.\n\nWriter/producer George Weiss (producer of Ed Wood's \"Glen or Glenda?\") and director Joseph Mawra were inspired by the '50s film-loops of Irving Klaw. Short fetish films of Bettie Page and others engaging in bondage, domination, pony play, etc.\n\nIn turn, the Olga films inspired \"Tortured Females\", \"Rent-A-Girl\", \"The Defilers\" (all 1965), \"The Lusting Hours\", \"Cool it, Baby\", \"Invitation to Ruin\" (all 1967), \"Cargo of Love\", \"The Bizarre Ones\" (1968), \"The Ultimate Degenerate\", and \"A Taste of Hot Lead\" (1969).\n\nThis is part of a series on the history of fetishism in mainstream films.",

A remarkable aspect is its seamless blending of new and archival footage in an attempt to give an unvarnished look at the true nature of war. In this it succeeds as well as any film I know. Highly recommended.",

When Joey meets the former chorus girl (\"She used to be 'Vera...with the Vanishing Veils'\") and now rich widow Vera Simpson, the two lecherous souls seem made for each other. That is, until Linda English comes along. Linda is a \"mouse on the  line\" and built like there's no tomorrow. But she's the typical good little girl from a good little home -- just the right ingredient to louse up Joey's cushy set up.\n\nStars: Rita Hayworth, Frank Sinatra, and Kim Novak",

This was a rogue non-Dracula vampire movie for MGM that ends in farce. (Universal had already begun to neglect Lugosi in favor of Karloff.) Columbia did the same thing with Lugosi in \"Return of the Vampire\" in 1943. That same year Universal made \"Son of Dracula\" with the miscast Lon Chaney. \n\nThe second trailer is for \"White Zombie\" (1932), a terrific little independent film. Lugosi supposedly directed a scene or two of this himself. ",

            "description": "The American release of \"Maciste All Inferno\" (1962) as \"The Witch's Curse\" is a good exemple of what US distributors were capable of to mislead the audience. They tried very hard to pass this fairly enjoyable sword and sandals film for an ordinary horror movie. Of course, the twisted plot including some 18th Century witch hunt and battling mighty Maciste drown from God knows which area made this title a bit tricky to classify. But all in all, it's more about half naked muscle men than devil worshipers, anyway.\nMost of the copies available are grainy pan and scanned public domain versions, cut down to 75 minutes.\nThe original one was a beautiful cinemascope 87 minutes film. Some excellent foreign dvds are also on the market, as \"Maciste en Enfer\" for instance (French and Italian versions only). Watch for them!\n\nMore info about the film on http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057268/",

Great fun to watch though. Roger Corman did sign the film but a lot of uncredited directors helped to finish it, including Jack Hill, star Nicholson and then beginner Francis Ford Coppola...\nParadoxically, the copy of this trailer is far better than most of the dvds of the film available on the market. Will anyone release a decent one in a near futur?\n\nMore info on http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057569/\n\nFor no apparent reason, only THE QUICKTIME DOWNLOAD has a descent soundtrack.",

It definitely is one of the most influential with its dance and production techniques still being seen in some of today's music videos. Originally written and produced for the big screen, \"Singin' in the Rain\" was later scaled down and adapted for the Broadway stage.\n\nTRIVIA: The title song \"Singin' in the Rain\" was originally from \"The Hollywood Revue of 1929.\" It was used again in \"Speak Easily\" (1932) which is available here at IA.  The original negative for \"Singin' in the Rain\" was lost in a fire. Most of this film's characters were based on the following real people: Louis B Mayer, Luella Parsons, Clara Bow, Erich von Stroheim, Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson.\n\nCAST NOTE: Nineteen-year-old Debbie Reynolds' fifth credited role and first starring role in a major production.",

As in most matinee cliffhangers the plot makes absolutely no sense. So check your brain at the door and have fun. If you're over 70 you might feel like a kid again.\n\nTRIVIA: The camera Gwyneth Paltrow uses is an Argus C3 which made 35mm photography popular in the US. More than 2 million were sold. The giant flying robots were directly referenced from the Paramount Superman cartoon \"Mechanical Monsters.\" There also are visual references to films like the original \"King Kong.\" The lines \"They're coming into sight above the Palisades. They're crossing 6th Avenue, 5th Avenue, they're 100 yards away!\" were lifted from Orson Welles' 1938 \"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast.\n\nNOTE: The Superman cartoon \"Mechanical Monsters\" is available in IA's Animation Shorts Collection here:\nhttps://archive.org/details/SupermanCartoonsVideoQualityUpgrades",

There's even a Pam Grier look-alike as this was most likely inspired by Roger Corman's \"The Big Bird Cage\" and \"Women in Cages\". \n\nClips: Here is the theatrical trailer with the usual over-heated narration: \".38 calibre kittens spitting death as they claw their way to freedom.\"  For the bullwhip bit, you can tell it's dipped in red paint to leave a mark. Flubs: Note how the \"stone\" guard tower (made of plywood) flies apart when hit by the jeep. Also you can see sparks from an exploding squib charge as a guard is shot in the chest. After the trailer, some rare out takes from a shower scene with a topless Davis (you're welcome).\n\n* See the \"Terminal Island\" posting for more hot Phyllis Davis outtakes.\n* And go to: Trailers: Women in Cages & The Big Bird Cage, prison exploitation",

I included dates where I know of multiple movies with the same title.\n \nIn this batch:Terror CreaturesThe Bad and the BeautifulThe BetrayalThe BirdsThe HearseThe HostageThe Last ChaseThe SandlotThe SearchersThe StatueThe Thing (1982)The Trip (1967)Three GodfathersThunder AlleyTo Catch a ThiefTopazTorn CurtainThe Trouble with HarryTrue RomanceTwo Weeks in Another TownWeekend PassWhite SandsWolfenWΔZ (a/k/a Killing Gene)Young Frankenstein 1Young Frankenstein 2Young Frankenstein 3Young Frankenstein 4Young Frankenstein 5\n\n",

Haven't seen it. IMDB rating 7.2, MPAA R. The DVD is unrated.\n\nTRIVIA: What the producers originally thought would be an easy film to shoot instead became a series production nightmares that resulted in major cost overruns. So don't look for a sequel.",

The FX and other production values are adequate for the story.\n\nTRIVIA: The alien spaceship interior set and other footage came from \"Earth vs the Flying Saucers.\"\n\nCAST NOTE: The deep voice of Dr George Voskovec (phd), who plays the alien, will be familiar to many old timers. Voskovec performed in dozens of radio dramas during the '40s and early '50s. He also appeared in more than 90 film and TV productions.",

            "description": "Synopsis\n\nThis short film shot in Tehran, recounts the adventures of two young street musicians who play the accordion and tablas in order to earn their living. Two young street musicians in Tehran, a boy and a girl, have their accordion confiscated as the result of an incident while playing next to a mosque. \n\nâThe Accordion is the story of humankindâs materialistic need to survive in a pretentious religion. In it, a boy is prevented from playing for reasons of religious prohibition, which he accepts in order to survive. But the main character of the film is the girl or, perhaps, in my view, the symbol of the next generation. In her ideal world she realizes manâs need for survival and decides to avoid the violence and share her small income with someone else who is also in need.â -- Jafar Panahi\n\n\n\nSegment of the film project \"THEN AND NOW Beyond Borders and Differences\" produced by ART for The World in 2010 and based on the article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion\".\n\n\"I'm a director who pays attention to social aspects and what's happening around me ... 'The Accordion' shows my feelings about what's happening and how I see reality,\" -- Jafar Panahi  \n\n\n\n\n\n*          *          * \n\nTwo children eke out their living on the streets of Tehran by playing their accordion. Passersby generously offer them coins, till the instrument is forcibly taken away by a man, who finds the children, a brother and sister, guilty of having played music just outside a mosque. The boy pleads to be forgiven, saying he just did not realise that he was outside a mosque. The children cry out in desperation; they need the money to buy medicines for their sick mother at home. But the man remains unmoved and disappears with the accordion into the cityâs labyrinth of lanes. \n\nA little later, the children spot the man sitting in a square playing the instrument. The boy gets hold of a stone, ready to hit him with it. The girl asks the brother not to do so. And as the children inch towards the man, he continues playing music and ultimately returns the accordion without any struggle.\n\nProbably, the power of music moved the man to compassion, to a higher state of tolerance. The movie is a powerful metaphor on violence, lenience and, finally, hope.  An absolute masterpiece, I would think. And, in nine minutes, Panahi shook us all up with a searing piece of truth. -- Gautaman Bhaskaran\n\n\n\n*          *          * \n\n\nOne of the most celebrated Iranian and international artists compresses his storytelling and reflections in a short film that not only captures Tehran today, but also serves as a metaphor on violence, tolerance and hope. It was, in fact, Jafar Pahaniâs vitality and courage here that sparked our passions most. \n\nHowever, the director would not have conceived this splendid âshort storyâ were it not for backing from the wonderful utopia that is the omnibus film Then and Now, dedicated to overcoming barriers and differences and produced by Art for the World with support from the United Nations. \n\nWe further await to see and applaud The Accordion in its final âhome,â alongside works from other great directors, including Tata Amaral, Fanny Ardant, Faouzi Bensaidi, Sergei Bodrov, Isabelle Coixet, Mahanat-Saleh Haroun, HÃ¼seyin Karabey, Masbedo, Murali Nair, Guka Omarova, Idrissa OuÃ©draogo, Abderrahmane Sissako and Robert Wilson. -- Giorgio Gosetti, Venice Days\n\nVenice (Venice Days), AFI (Short Films) \nSelected filmography of Jafar Panahi \n\nThe Accordion (2010) \nOffside (2006) \nTalaye sorkh (2003) - Crimson Gold (2003) \nThe Circle - Dayereh (2000) \nThe Mirror - Ayneh (1997) \nArdekoul (1997) \nThe White Balloon - Badkonake sefid (1995) \nDoust (1992) \nAkharin Emtehan (1992) \nKish (1991) \nYarali bashlar (1988) \n",

Filmed in Rome and various other Italian locations.\n\nTRIVIA: The estimated production cost was $10 million, a laughable figure today. It lost $8 million worldwide.\n\nCAST NOTE: To the end of his days Rex Harrison detested Charlton Heston.",

In addition to the impact of its famous show-stopping scenes it illustrates the silent screen's ability to tell simple stories both with nuance and great power. Check it out.

Not satisfied with that, MGM skillfully swindled its naive young director King Vidor out of his 20% stake in the profits.\n",

Too bad, as it looks like fun. A typical nudie cutie that played in adults-only grind house venues at that time. By the late '60s these films became a bit more story-driven, instead of the passive voyeurism seen a few years earlier.\n\nDirected by Manuel Conde, who did a dozen forgettable nudies and softcore porn films. The cast are mostly one-shot actors. The blonde stripper Cindy Embers (at 1:26) bears a disturbing likeness to Debbie Reynolds.\n\nThis is part of a long series of vintage exploitation trailers, montages, and fetish stag films from the '30s to the '60s that I have archived at this site.",

            "description": "Synopsis \nHow does art survive in a time of oppression? During the Soviet rule artists who stay true to their vision are executed, sent to mental hospitals or Gulags.\n\nTheir plight inspires young Igor Savitsky. He pretends to buy state-approved art but instead daringly rescues 40,000 forbidden fellow artist's works and creates a museum in the desert of Uzbekistan, far from the watchful eyes of the KGB. \n\n\n\nThough a penniless artist himself, he cajoles the cash to pay for the art from the same authorities who are banning it. Savitsky amasses an eclectic mix of Russian Avant-Garde art.\n\n\n\nBut his greatest discovery is an unknown school of artists who settle in Uzbekistan after the Russian revolution of 1917, encountering a unique Islamic culture, as exotic to them as Tahiti was for Gauguin. \n\n\n\nThey develop a startlingly original style, fusing European modernism with centuries-old Eastern traditions.\n\n\n\nBen Kingsley, Sally Field and Ed Asner voice the diaries and letters of Savitsky and the artists. Intercut with recollections of the artists' children and rare archival footage, the film takes us on a dramatic journey of sacrifice for the sake of creative freedom.\n\n\n\nDescribed as \"one of the most remarkable collections of 20th century Russian art\" and located in one of the world's poorest regions, today these paintings are worth millions, a lucrative target for Islamic fundamentalists, corrupt bureaucrats and art profiteers.\n\n\n\nThe collection remains as endangered as when Savitsky first created it, posing the question whose responsibility is it to preserve this cultural treasure. -- The Desert of Forbidden Art\n\n",

It is set in the years preceding and and immediately following the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180CE. However the Western Roman Empire didn't fall until 475CE. So ignore the muddled screenplay, pop some popcorn and enjoy the spectacle which is truly amazing. Released in 1964. IMDB rating 6.7.TRIVIA: The hugely expensive production followed by its box office flop insured it would be the last Roman sword and sandal epic until the release of \"Gladiator\" in 2000.",

            "description": "The Fish Fall in Love - mahi ha ashegh mishavand (2004)\nSynopsis\n\nThe Fish Fall in Love by {Ali Rafi'i} is a simple and gentle film that adapts the same language of food, this time from northern Iranian cuisine, to speak of life. This is a film that will leave its taste in the pallet long after the curtains have dropped.\n\n \n\nThe sound of the Caspian, the beautiful images that accompany it (true, they are somewhat touristy), will imprint themselves on the memory, even with the realization that the characters peopling this movie are unlike any you may see or come across. And why not? We shouldn't expect every movie to be deep and philosophical, solving humanity's problems in an hour and a half, should we?\n\n \n\nThe Fish Fall in Love is the veteran theater director's first film and it is an unexpectedly good one, void of the director's usual theatrics. Perhaps the director has now come to terms with his audience on the silver screen, which has a more general viewership. \n\nRafi'i's last play, It Doesn't Snow in Egypt, didn't do well with Tehrani theater-goers. In an interview with Hamshahri newspaper, he unjustifiably called those who went to the City Theater \"Potato-chips and cheese-puff audiences,\" who had no stomach to grasp his work. This is when he had earlier eulogized Vahdat Hall audiences cultured and erudite.\n\n  \n\nPerhaps it is more the case that Vahdat Hall has attendees that seldom care if they are seeing a {Pari Saberi} play, the choreography of {Farid Masuleh}, or the music of {Loris Tchekovaria}, while the more serious audiences went to the City Theater to see a play. \n\nIt could be that this smooth and sweet movie, with its beautiful scenes, indicates that Rafi'i is done insulting his audiences. ( By Jinoos Taghizadeh, Hamed Safaee, Sima Saeedi, Mohammadreza Fakhrabadi info@tehranavenue.com ) \n\n\n \n\nCast: Reza Kianian, Roya Nonahali, Golshifteh Farahani, Maryam Saadat, Farokh Nemati, Siamak Safari, Mehdi Pakdel, Alireza Oliaee, Sina Razani \n\n\nAbout this movie\n\nTitle: The Fish Fall in Love - mahi ha ashegh mishavand (2004)\nDirected by: Ali Rafiee\nDate of birth: 1938, Isfahan, Iran\nWriting credits: Ali Rafiee\nMusic: Ali Samadpour\n\nYear: 2004\nCountry: Iran\nLanguage: Farsi\nColor: Color\nRuntime: 96 min.",

            "description": "A grand, old school dramatic adventure in the Kordas' British Empire series. Solid primary cast supported by thousands of extras. Magnificent, historicly accurate production filmed in the UK and what in 1939 was the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. A must-see specticale from the golden age of British film. Filmed before in 1915, 1921, 1929 and most recently in 2002.\n\nMORE: The often-filmed \"The Four Feathers\" is historical fiction set during the 18-year struggle with a radical Muslim rebellion in the Sudan. \"Khartoum,\" staring Carlton Heston and Laurence Olivier, is another worthy film which dramatizes events of this period. \n\nTHE FACTS: Winston Churchill's non-fiction \"The River War\" covers in great detail the Mahdi rebellion, the death of General Gordon and the reconquest of the Sudan. It's highly recommended for history buffs and military history buffs. It is available as a free audio book in the Librivox Collection, here:\nhttps://archive.org/details/riverwar_1003_librivox\n\nDVD: Unfortunately this film fell victim to the GATT Treaty, and is no longer here at IA. However in 2011 Criterion released the 115 minute version on DVD.",

She begins an unknown and mysterious journey in Tehran in order to explore the world around. She goes everywhere in town-from the lush orchards of uptown to the dwelling quarters of the people who have come to dead-ends of their lives... \n\n \n\nDirector's View \n\n\"The film and the tale is a new experience in dealing with the subjective preoccupations of a number of the young people in our society. I sincerely hope that their number, which is already considerable, will not increase as time goes by. I don't know how successful we will be in dealing with this dillema, but perhaps our sincerity and belief will be of great help.\"  -- FCF\n\nCast: \n\nPegah Ahangarani ....

Strange as it seems now, during the early stages of production it was thought of as a star vehicle for David Niven, not Sellers.\n\nTRIVIA: The second Clouseau comedy, \"A Shot in the Dark,\" was released only three months after this film. Its trailer is in this collection.\n\nCAST NOTE: Claudia Cardinale was less than fluent in English. Much of her dialog was dubbed by Gale Garnett.",

            "description": "-\n\"The Ramrodder\" (1969) is an adult western that's part nudie-cutie, part violent \"roughie\". Produced by an uncredited David F. Friedman and directed by Ed Forsyth under the alias Van Guylder. Notorious for its connection to Charles Manson as well as its lurid sado-masochistic whipping scene with Kathy Williams. \n\nThe movie features many scenes of R-rated sex plus nude dancing, bodypainting, skinny-dipping, abduction, lesbianism and a topless cat-fight with knives.\n\nFilmed party at Spahn Ranch where Charles Manson's \"family\" lived, including Catherine Share - who plays an Indian maiden. Manson's friend Bobby Beausoleil also appears as an Indian. \n\nIn August 1969, Beausoleil was arrested for stabbing a man to death over a drug deal dispute. A few days later, Manson had his followers commit a series of \"copycat\" crimes (the infamous Sharon Tate & LaBianca murders) in large part to make it look like Beausoleil was innocent.\n\nThis, and another trailer, claims a major Hollywood studio backed this film but had their name kept secret. The better-than-usual quality of the cinematography, editing, music, and other details suggest that this may be true. At any rate, this was one of the last period-piece sexploitation films. By the '70s \"nudies\" gave way to mainstream porn and the roughie genre blended into the new wave of violent, R-rated horror shockers.\n\nThis is part of a series on vintage underground cinema. To see more postings, search for \"exploitation\", \"sexploitation\" \"fetish film\" and \"stag film\". Other film clips and promos include: Nunsploitation, Olga's House of Shame, A Taste of Hot Lead, The Defilers, The Love Girls, Rent-A-Girl, Olga's Girls, Motel Confidential, Cool It Baby, All Women are Bad, Honey, women in prison and '30s French fetish films, Irving Klaw, Bettie Page, et al.\n\n-------------------------",

If you're into sci fi movie cheese they don't come much cheesier or sillier than \"The Slime People.\" If you get a perverse kick out atrocious acting, you'll fall in love with its cast. It's so bad it's astonishing, and a must-see for us bad movie addicts.TRIVIA: The two drunks in the theater scene also were the producer and associate producer. The freezer scene was filmed in a butcher shop owned by actor/director Robert Hutton's father-in-law. Robert Hutton never has been paid for this film. Saying this was justified is mean but understandable.POST SCRIPT: Susan Hart (Lisa) went on to a minor career in television. She also had a supporting role in \"War-Gods of the Deep\" which again exposed her limitations. Robert Hutton exited the US for film work in the UK where it's assumed no one had seen \"The Slime People.\"",

            "description": "Mega-hit musical drama of the lives of the the von Trapp Family Singers and their escape from Nazi Austria. A star-maker for Julie andrews with excellent production values. However it shouldn't counted on for biographical or historical accuracy. Partially filmed on location in Salzburg, Austria. Added to the National Film Registry in 2001.\n\nTRIVIA: The third highest grossing movie of all time, adjusted for inflation. Maria von Trapp was not invited to or allowed to attend its preview.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE: My Austrian-born mother was a long-time friend of Maria von Trapp whom she visited several times in her Stowe, Vermont home. Maria passed away in 1987. My mom followed her in 1989. So it's now safe for me to admit I'm among the five people on the planet who didn't much care for \"The Sound of Music.\"",

A true classic that holds up exceptionally well today.\n\nTRIVIA; Partly filmed in Glacier National Park and at a Los Angeles ice storage plant.\n\nNOTE: Beware of prints that run less than 87 minutes.",

It was the first sound-era white jungle girl adventure. Many more would follow. (see note) Yes it's old and it creaks at times, nevertheless it also is a surprisingly engaging film that's worth checking out now that it's been reissued on DVD. It was badly remade in 1973.\nBEST LINE: Harry Carey: \"Dragin' a woman is scratchy work.\"\nNOTE: Jungle girl adventures here at IA: \"Blonde Savage,\" \"Bowanga Bowanga,\" \"Liane, Jungle Goddess,\" \"Nabonga,\" \"Prehistoric Women\" 1950, \"Queen of the Amazons,\" \"The Savage Girl,\" \"The Wild Women of Wongo,\" \"Queen of the Jungle\"(serial) and \"Sheena Queen of the Jungle\" (TV series).

Alone except for his dog, Flike, Umberto strives to maintain his dignity while trying to survive in a city where traditional human kindness seems to have lost out to the forces of modernization. \n\nUmbertoâs simple quest to fulfill the most fundamental human needsâfood, shelter, companionshipâis one of the most heartbreaking stories ever filmed and an essential classic of world cinema. -- The Criterion Collection\n",

            "description": "Synopsis\n\nIn Italy, for thirty odd years, the image has been controlled by one man. TV-magnate and Presidente Silvio Berlusconi has influenced the content of commercial television in a way never before done in Italy. \n\n\n\nSilvio Berlusconi has created the perfect system of politics and entertainment. His major television channels, which are known for their overuse of half naked women, seen by many as an expression of his own taste and personality.\n\nIn Videocracy, Italian-born director Erik Gandini portrays the consequences of a TV-experiment that Italians have been subjected to for 30 years. \n\nGaining unique access to the most powerful media spheres, he unveils a remarkable story, born out of the scary reality of âTV-Republicâ Italy.\n\nCast: Silvio Berlusconi, Flavio Briatore, Fabrizio Corona, Lele Mora, Simona Ventura\n\n\nAwards\n\nBest Documentary, Toronto Film Festival\nInaugural Special Jury Award, Sheffield Film Festival\nCitti Award to Erik Gandini, Golden Graal (PDF in Italian)\nTempo Documentary Award 2010 (Best film)\nCrossing Europe Award 2010 Linz, Austria\n\nReviews\n\nErik Gandiniâs Videocracy is an intriguing, mordant look at the world of Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi: an acrid Dolce Vita for the modern dayâ¦ a dreamy, mesmeric and highly disturbing psychogeography of 21st century Italy, or perhaps a meandering anthropological study of a disfunctional cult, ruled by a thin-skinned, self-pitying lader. -- Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian \n\nThe combination of terrific footage with a low, rumbling score of doom makes this a compelling horror show. -- Dave Colhoun, Time Out London\n\nTragicomic in its natureâ¦ the politics-entertainment mix is chilling -- Kate Muir, The Times\n\nErik Gandiniâs documentary is the swedish horror film of the year -- Dagens Nyheter (in Swedish)\n",

Recommended as an entertaining companion piece for \"Edison the Man\" starring Spencer Tracy.\n\nCAST NOTE: Spencer Tracy and silent film star Claire McDowell appear as uncredited extras.\n\nNOTE: The trailer for \"Edison the Man\" also is in this collection.",

The family is now near ruin, but Adélaïde and Félicie nonetheless still squander away the family money on themselves and keeping beautiful, whereas Belle slaves around the house, doting on her father. Ludovic detests his two spoiled sisters, but is protective of Belle, especially with his friend Avenant, a handsome scoundrel who wants to marry Belle. Crossing the forest one dark and stormy evening, the father gets lost and takes refuge in a fantastical castle. Upon leaving, he steals a blossom off a rose bush, which Belle requested. The castle's resident, an angry beast, sentences him to one of two options for the theft of the rose: his own death, or that of one of his daughters. As she feels she is the cause of her father's predicament (despite her sisters asking for far more lavish gifts).\n\nIMDb reviewer, Kinch417, wrote...\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" not only beautifully re-tells a beautiful story, but powerfully displays the Beast's magic. Cocteau's genius is that he makes simple editing techniques look like art and in this movie like the combination of art and magic. \n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" [Wikipedia]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_%281946_film%29\n\nJean Cocteau [Wikipedia]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau",

Watch this movie once and the constantly repeated title theme will be hard to forget.\n\nQUESTION: Was the obviously phallic battering ram scene (a bit of which is seen in this trailer) the result of a camera angle accident? Or was it intentional?",

A group of survivors living in a cave run out of water and desperately need to locate a new supply. The last guy they sent out to find water never returned, and now his 10 year old son Timmy wants to join the next search team. They think they know where there's an untapped well of water, but to get there they have to travel through dangerous terrain controlled by a savage gang of motorcyclists under the bloodthirsty reign of 'Crazy Bull'. On their mission, Timmy and his team run into a lonesome stranger named Alien (Robert Iannucci) who may be able to help them against the marauding motorcyclists. Can the struggling survivors looking for water in this barren world defeat Crazy Bull and his exterminating minions? Hang on tight - the battle has just begun!",

Via her recovered memories, she is able to lead Redding and his associates to a hidden chamber in the Great Pyramid of Yucatan, where they hope to find the lost treasure of the Aztecs. Instead, they find two mummified bodies - one of a modern man, quite dead, and the other of an ancient Aztec, quite alive. They are able to return safely to Pasadena with both finds, but a rival professor, Janney, kills Redding and steals the body of the modern man-mummy. This he subjects to a resurrection experiment, which works - only the mummy proves to be a werewolf. Two supernatural menaces roam the city that night.  This film is composed of footage from two unrelated Mexican horror movies, LA CASA DEL TERROR and LA MOMIA AZTECA, plus new footage shot in the U.S. by Jerry Warren.",

There are 700 other prisoners, making Matsu number 701. Her crime was making a failed attempt to stab Sugimi on the steps of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Headquarters because he used her to win favor with the Yakuza. While in prison she meets inmates like Yuki Kida (Yayoi Watanabe) who was committed for fraud and theft, Otsuka (Akemi Negishi), jailed for burglary and extortion, and Katagiri (Rie Yokoyama) who has been impounded for arson and illegally disposing of a body.",

When Jim Jones becomes increasingly obsessed with the belief that the CIA is \"a wicked enemy\" who is out to get him, he emigrates with his congregation to Guyana, where he plans to create a utopia. But Jim Jones' utopia consists of a society where he demands his followers turn their minds, bodies and possessions over to him, one that is rife with orgies, physical violence, mental torture, and sexual abuse of children and adults. Ultimately, Jim Jones' paranoia reaches a fevered pitch that culminates in him taking savage action against his own congregation. (VCI Home Video)",

This malady causes its victims to enter a state of age regression that starts at the age of ten and continues throughout the remainder of the person's life, rendering them with the intelligence of a child. The final generation of the family has been entrusted to the care of the family chauffeur (Lon Chaney Jr), and all is well for these odd people until a greedy branch of the family decides that they want to relieve the family of its home. Mental illness has always, and will always be, a fascinating subject for horror movies as it probes into the unknown and Spider Baby makes best use of that fact.",

The action takes place during the WWII and reveals the sharp clash between police power and resistance forces, headed by the Communist Party of Bulgaria. This is a time when, 'in the name of the people', the fighters are setting up underground combat groups, which punish with death their political opponents. The film's characters are specially trained for the purpose young people, members of one such combat group. Against the background of their risky task, in the execution of which they have to pay with their own lives, every facet of their characters stands out. Faced with death they reveal their intimate worlds, their unrealized youthful impulses that have been sacrificed in the name of commands, disparate from the Ten Christian Commandments.",

Iconic performers Bill Margold, Tyler Reynolds and Con Covert stir up all manner of naughty behavior, with a sprinkle of John Holmes. The story of a candy factory that avoids a hostile takeover through a revolutionary new lollipop gets about as much disinterest from the filmmakers as it probably will from you. But with the miracle of 3-D, you'll be close enough to taste the action! The Pasadena Courier says \"3-D is what makes the film a riot. One can't help but crack-up at the various body parts that appear to be jiggling, bouncing, dangling and squirting right off the screen.\" 3-D glasses provided. Also known as M3-D: The Movie.

Rescued by two Vietnamvets-turned-heavies who are out relaxing after their latest job, their boat eventually runs aground on a Carribean island nearby where, upon going ashore, it is discovered that everything has been destroyed and everybody killed. The culprits, a vicious group of well-armed raiders, and their leader, Crystal Skull, are descendants of Atlantis' original race who set about reclaiming the world and adding the survivors to the list of victims as they struggle to stay alive and defeat the raiders and send Atlantis back to the ocean floor.",
